The ChEMBL database in 2017,"ChEMBL is an open large-scale bioactivity database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl), previously described in the 2012 and 2014 Nucleic Acids Research Database Issues. Since then, alongside the continued extraction of data from the medicinal chemistry literature, new sources of bioactivity data have also been added to the database. These include: deposited data sets from neglected disease screening; crop protection data; drug metabolism and disposition data and bioactivity data from patents. A number of improvements and new features have also been incorporated. These include the annotation of assays and targets using ontologies, the inclusion of targets and indications for clinical candidates, addition of metabolic pathways for drugs and calculation of structural alerts. The ChEMBL data can be accessed via a web-interface, RDF distribution, data downloads and RESTful web-services.",https://openalex.org/W2558999090,2016,Anna Gaulton; Anne Hersey; Michał Nowotka,European Bioinformatics Institute
Ontology-based neural network for patent knowledge management in design collaboration,"In order to stimulate innovation during the collaborative process of new product and production development, especially to avoid duplicating existing techniques or infringing upon others' patents and intellectual property rights, the collaborative team of research and development, and patent engineers must accurately identify relevant patent knowledge in a timely manner. This research develops a novel knowledge management approach using ontology-based artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm to automatically classify and search knowledge documents stored in huge online patent corpuses. This research focuses on developing a smart and semantic oriented classification and search from the sources of the most critical and well-structured knowledge publications, i.e. patents, to gain valuable and practical references for the collaborative networks of technology-centric product and production development teams. The research uses the domain ontology schema created using Protégé and derives the semantic concept probabilities of key phrases that frequently occur in domain relevant patent documents. Then, by combining the term frequencies and the concept probabilities of key phrases as the ANN inputs, the method shows significant improvement in classification accuracy. In addition, this research provides an advanced semantic-oriented search algorithm to accurately identify related patent documents in the patent knowledge base. The case demonstration analyses 343 chemical mechanical polishing and 150 radio-frequency identification patents sample sets to verify and measure the performance of the proposed approach. The results are compared with the previous automatic classification methods demonstrating much improved outcomes.",https://openalex.org/W2146235381,2012,Amy J.C. Trappey; Charles V.

Design and Implementation of Derwent Patent Ontology,"The evolution of information technology, especially Semantic Web, has stimulated information requirements and the progress of processing methods. In order to improve the efficiency of information processing in the field of patent research, this article designed a Derwent patent ontology based on the content of documents and the semantic relationship within them. We implement the patent ontology in OWL form, and discussed the ways of organize the instances in different concepts/classes, which contributed to store the Derwent patent information in logic medium. The research built patent family citation network and try to find the core based on ontology and knowledge inference.",https://openalex.org/W2369621701,2013,Zhai Dong-shen,Beijing University of Technology
A Modular Framework for Ontology-based Representation of Patent Information,"Abstract. In this paper, we present a new ontology-based formalism for representing patent information. The framework defines concepts and relations for the major aspects of patent information pertaining to patent metadata, patent content structure, patent semantics, and patent classification. Each aspect is logically covered by an individual ontology module. The paper further discusses aspects of ontology learning and integration of non-textual information for the patent domain.",https://openalex.org/W2164689972,2007,Mark Giereth; Steffen Koch; Ioannis Kompatsiaris,University of Stuttgart; Information Technologies Institute
Patent Classification Using Ontology-Based Patent Network Analysis,"Patent management is increasingly important for organizations to sustain their competitive advantage. The classification of patents is essential for patent management and industrial analysis. In this study, we propose a novel patent network-based classification method to analyze query patents and predict their classes. The proposed patent network, which contains various types of nodes that represent different features extracted from patent documents, is constructed based on the relationship metrics derived from patent metadata. The novel approach analyzes reachable nodes in the patent ontology network to calculate their relevance to query patents, after which it uses the modified k-nearest neighbor classifier to classify query patents. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a test dataset of patent documents obtained from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and compare it with the performance of the three conventional methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed patent network-based approach outperforms the conventional approaches.",https://openalex.org/W93327894,2010,Meng Jung Shih; Duen‐Ren Liu,National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University
Supporting Patent Mining by using Ontology-based Semantic Annotations,"Semantic web approach seems interesting for supporting content mining of millions of patents accessible through the Web.

This method, primarily aimed at helping biologists use patent information can be generalized to all kinds of domains or of structured documents.",https://openalex.org/W2102717894,2007,Nizar Ghoula; Khaled Khelif; Rose Dieng-Kuntz,Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies du numérique
Developing an ontology for the U.S. patent system,"The past few years have experienced an explosive growth in scientific and regulatory documents related to the patent system. Relevant information is siloed into many heterogeneous information domains making it a challenging task to gather information. In this paper, we develop an ontology to standardize the representation of the patent system in order to overcome the heterogeneity and integrate information from the patent document, court case and file wrapper domains. Through a use case in the bio domain erythropoietin, we demonstrate how this ontology can be used as a tool to improve the learning curve of users gathering information across these multiple information domains. The proposed ontology provides the required semantics to develop automated tools for a variety of purposes including Information Retrieval (IR) and analytics.",https://openalex.org/W2024576284,2011,Siddharth Taduri; Gloria T.

How did the gene become a chemical compound? The ontology of the gene and the patenting of DNA,"The ability to patent is bounded by a set of conditions that define what is patentable and what is not. In the 1980s, the problem of the patentability of genes was solved by the use of an analogy between genes and chemical compounds. In this article we analyze the process of the reduction of the gene to a chemical compound, and show how this analogy made the practice of gene patenting routine long before it came to public attention. When we did eventually see public controversies surrounding gene patenting in the 1990s, the chemical analogy allowed patent offices in the US and Europe to ‘close down’ these debates by presenting the issues as merely technical.",https://openalex.org/W2038460857,2011,Jane Calvert; Pierre‐Benoît Joly,Edinburgh College; University of Edinburgh; Paris-Est Sup
Intelligent Extraction of a Knowledge Ontology From Global Patents,"The growth of global patents increased over the last decade as enterprises and inventors sought greater protection of their intellectual property (IP) rights. Global patents represent state-of-the-art knowledge for given domains. This research develops a hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based approach as a computational intelligent method to discover topics and form a top-down ontology, a semantic schema, representing the collective patent knowledge. To validate the knowledge extraction, 1,546 smart retailing patents collected from the Derwent Innovation platform from 2011 and 2016 are used to build the domain ontology schema. The patent set focuses on in-use, globally established, and non-disputed IP covering payment, user experience, and information integration for smart retailing. The clustering and LDA-based ontology system automatically build the knowledge map, which identifies the technology trends and the technology gaps enabling the development of competitive R&amp;D and management strategies.",https://openalex.org/W3092273740,2020,Amy J.C.

Tracing the Evolution of Biomedical 3D Printing Technology Using Ontology-Based Patent Concept Analysis,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing enables products to be custom-designed and produced using additive manufacturing processes. This research develops a patent analysis approach to explore biomedical 3D printing technology trends. First, the method searches for related patents. Second, frequently appearing key terms in patents are extracted as a means to identify key concepts of inventions. Third, in order to structure the domain knowledge, the ontology is created by referring to the relevant key terms and literature. The key terms create indexes used to measure similarities for clustering the patents and sub-technologies. Based on the patent context and dynamic patent concept analysis maps, the evolutionary trends of technology development are depicted. Biomedical 3D printing R&D projects are used as case examples to compare against co-occurring patent evolutions. The proposed patent concept analysis is generalisable for critical decision support of R&D planning and evaluation in any market sector.",https://openalex.org/W2499485200,2016,Amy J.C.

Using patents to populate an inventive design ontology,"TRIZ theory is largely based on patent's observation, and as we’ve learned from TRIZ, key issues (amongst others) like automatic contradiction extraction, accurately estimate a patent's level of Inventiveness, are still to be efficiently addressed. An evident bottleneck lies in the necessary cross disciplinary research to be undertaken between data/text mining algorithms, Design theories and methodologies and psychological aspects of creativity. This paper is firstly proposing to summarize key contributions and major research bottlenecks in patents usage in the scope of TRIZ-related practices. Then a positioning between TRIZ and our Inventive Design Method is exposed. A third part reports on our contribution, it consist in a framework aiming at extracting and representing know-how of domain experts and populating an already constructed Ontology of Inventive Design. This framework is using the notion of problem graph and polycontradictions.

Ontology-based heuristic patent search,"Purpose Large collections of patent documents disclosing novel, non-obvious technologies are publicly available and beneficial to academia and industries. To maximally exploit its potential, searching these patent documents has increasingly become an important topic. Although much research has processed a large size of collections, a few studies have attempted to integrate both patent classifications and specifications for analyzing user queries. Consequently, the queries are often insufficiently analyzed for improving the accuracy of search results. This paper aims to address such limitation by exploiting semantic relationships between patent contents and their classification. Design/methodology/approach The contributions are fourfold. First, the authors enhance similarity measurement between two short sentences and make it 20 per cent more accurate. Second, the Graph-embedded Tree ontology is enriched by integrating both patent documents and classification scheme. Third, the ontology does not rely on rule-based method or text matching; instead, an heuristic meaning comparison to extract semantic relationships between concepts is applied. Finally, the patent search approach uses the ontology effectively with the results sorted based on their most common order. Findings The experiment on searching for 600 patent documents in the field of Logistics brings better 15 per cent in terms of F-Measure when compared with traditional approaches. Research limitations/implications The research, however, still requires improvement in which the terms and phrases extracted by Noun and Noun phrases making less sense in some aspect and thus might not result in high accuracy. The large collection of extracted relationships could be further optimized for its conciseness. In addition, parallel processing such as Map-Reduce could be further used to improve the search processing performance. Practical implications The experimental results could be used for scientists and technologists to search for novel, non-obvious technologies in the patents. Social implications High quality of patent search results will reduce the patent infringement. Originality/value The proposed ontology is semantically enriched by integrating both patent documents and their classification. This ontology facilitates the analysis of the user queries for enhancing the accuracy of the patent search results.",https://openalex.org/W2903453404,2018,Cong-Phuoc Phan; Hong-Quang Nguyen; Tan-Tai Nguyen,Ho Chi Minh City International University

Deriving Competitive Foresight Using an Ontology-Based Patent Roadmap and Valuation Analysis,"An ontology-based patent roadmap and valuation analysis approach provides competitive foresights for a corporation's associated patent portfolios and the underlying business processes. To demonstrate the methodology and computer supported analysis system, the patent portfolios of two global smart e-retailers are compared. The patents in each company's portfolio are text mined and categorized based on the smart retailing ontology schema. Both cases' text mining results are plotted as patent portfolio roadmaps, linking patents to innovation categories, commercial applications, and business process models. The three-dimensional (3-D) patent valuation analysis method provides foresights of the companies' competitive advantages related to “patent scope” (PS), “patent importance” (PI), and “patent innovation” (PIN). The research implements a computer supported system to provide evidence how companies utilize patent portfolios as key strategies for protecting business related intellectual properties (IPs) while implementing sustainable and competitive business processes.",https://openalex.org/W2914506166,2019,Amy J.C.

DrugBank 3.0: a comprehensive resource for 'Omics' research on drugs,"DrugBank (http://www.drugbank.ca) is a richly annotated database of drug and drug target information. It contains extensive data on the nomenclature, ontology, chemistry, structure, function, action, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, metabolism and pharmaceutical properties of both small molecule and large molecule (biotech) drugs. It also contains comprehensive information on the target diseases, proteins, genes and organisms on which these drugs act. First released in 2006, DrugBank has become widely used by pharmacists, medicinal chemists, pharmaceutical researchers, clinicians, educators and the general public. Since its last update in 2008, DrugBank has been greatly expanded through the addition of new drugs, new targets and the inclusion of more than 40 new data fields per drug entry (a 40% increase in data 'depth'). These data field additions include illustrated drug-action pathways, drug transporter data, drug metabolite data, pharmacogenomic data, adverse drug response data, ADMET data, pharmacokinetic data, computed property data and chemical classification data. DrugBank 3.0 also offers expanded database links, improved search tools for drug-drug and food-drug interaction, new resources for querying and viewing drug pathways and hundreds of new drug entries with detailed patent, pricing and manufacturer data. These additions have been complemented by enhancements to the quality and quantity of existing data, particularly with regard to drug target, drug description and drug action data. DrugBank 3.0 represents the result of 2 years of manual annotation work aimed at making the database much more useful for a wide range of 'omics' (i.e. pharmacogenomic, pharmacoproteomic, pharmacometabolomic and even pharmacoeconomic) applications.",https://openalex.org/W2137052779,2010,Craig Knox; Vivian Law; Timothy Jewison,University of Alberta; National Institute for Nanotechnology
From patent law to regulation: the ontological gerrymandering of biotechnology,"Biotechnology is (ontologically speaking) many things. US patent law's understanding of 'the natural' has shrunk over the decades to allow the patenting of artefacts – such as organisms, cell lines, chemical compounds, and cDNA – that would previously have been unpatentable. However, when attempting to garner public support or minimise regulatory hurdles, proponents of biotechnology emphasise how these artefacts are no different from their un-engineered counterparts – that they are, in a word, natural. Some political implications of this ontological gerrymandering are discussed by focusing on instances of resistance, where previously hidden assemblages and networks (which proponents of biotechnology do not want the public to see) are being made visible.",https://openalex.org/W2129086005,2008,Michael Carolan,Colorado State University

Retrieval of Patent Documents from Heterogeneous Sources Using Ontologies and Similarity Analysis,"In the past few years, there has been an explosive growth in scientific and legal information related to the patent system. Patents and related documents are siloed into multiple heterogeneous sources. Retrieving relevant information from diverse sources is a non-trivial task and poses many technical challenges. Among the challenges is the issue of terminological inconsistencies that are used in the documents. We tackle the terminological inconsistency issue by exploring domain knowledge through the use of ontology standards. Furthermore, we take advantage of cross-references and structural dependencies between the information sources to enhance terminological comparison. In this paper, we present a similarity analysis methodology which combines knowledge from two distinct sources -- (1) domain ontologies and (2) ontologies which describe the information sources to assist a user in identifying relevant documents across several information sources simultaneously. Specifically, we explore the use of a rule-based system to infer relationships between documents based on pre-defined heuristics. We present our results through a use case in the bio-patent domain with a collection of 1150 patents and 30 court cases.",https://openalex.org/W2013608487,2011,Siddharth Taduri; Gloria T.

A patent system ontology for facilitating retrieval of patent related information,"The recent years have seen a tremendous growth in research and developments in science and technology, and an emphasis in obtaining Intellectual Property (IP) protection for one's innovations. Information pertaining to IP for science and technology is siloed into many diverse sources and consists of laws, regulations, patents, court litigations, scientific publications, and more. Although a great deal of legal and scientific information is now available online, the scattered distribution of the information, combined with the enormous sizes and complexities, makes any attempt to gather relevant IP-related information on a specific technology a daunting task. This paper describes a knowledge-based software framework to facilitate retrieval of patents and related information across multiple diverse and uncoordinated information sources in the US patent system. The document corpus covers issued US patents, court litigations, scientific publications, and patent file wrappers in the biomedical technology domain.",https://openalex.org/W2058120437,2012,Siddharth Taduri; Gloria T.

An Ontology-Based Automatic Semantic Annotation Approach for Patent Document Retrieval in Product Innovation Design,"Patent retrieval plays a very important role in product innovation design. However, current patent retrieval approaches lack semantic comprehension and association, and usually cannot capture the implicit useful knowledge at a semantic level. In order to improve the traditional patent search, this paper proposes a novel ontology-based automatic semantic annotation approach based on the thorough analysis of patent documents, which combines both structure and content characteristics, and integrates multiple techniques from various aspects. Multilayer semantic model is established to realize unified semantic representation. The approach first utilizes template schemes to extract the structure information from patent documents, and then identifies semantics of entities and relations between entities from the content based on natural language processing techniques and domain knowledge, and at last employs a heuristic pattern learning method to abstract patent technical features. Case study is provided to show that our approach can acquire multi-level patent semantic knowledge from multiple perspectives, and discover semantic correlations between patent documents, which can further promote the accurate patent semantic retrieval effectively.",https://openalex.org/W2039482486,2013,Feng Wang; Lan Fen Lin; Yang Zhou,Zhejiang University
Interpreting Design Structure in Patents Using an Ontology Library,"Patents contain valuable information for engineering design. However, the increasing number of annual patent publications makes it difficult for any individual designer to assimilate all up-to-date knowledge hidden in patent documents.

The study combined natural language processing (NLP) techniques, text data-mining, ontological engineering, and our rule-based tree generation method. Data sources and adopted tools included online patent documents, knowledge gathered from engineering textbooks, WordNet, a part-of-speech tagger developed by the Stanford NLP group, and Graphviz. We showed that the framework proposed in the paper not only could help minimize manual work required for obtaining design structures but also enable automatic dissimilarity comparison between patents.",https://openalex.org/W2007229029,2013,Zhen Li; Derrick Tate,Texas Tech University
Utilization of Bio-Ontologies for Enhancing Patent Information Retrieval,"The ability to access existing patents and patent-related information can have significant impacts on technology development and commercial markets. While such information is now available online, requesting the information about a specific technology remains a nontrivial task. The reason is that the online information often resides in different storage sources, is based on different modeling paradigms, and is managed by different independent entities. Ontology is one modeling paradigm that can capture semantically rich knowledge about a specific domain and its existing patents. That knowledge can be used to facilitate information sharing and information interoperability. This paper focuses on the bio-medical domain, where numerous patents have been filed in recent years. Specifically, this paper describes a computational framework that can facilitate the retrieval of intellectual property (IP-) related information in the bio-medical domain.",https://openalex.org/W2958148269,2019,Siddarth Taduri; Kincho H.

"Automatic ontology generation from patents using a pre-built library, WordNet and a class-based n-gram model","An ontology is defined as a structured, hierarchical way for describing domain knowledge. Research work regarding ontological engineering has yielded fruitful results, but these methods share a common drawback: they require significant manual work to generate an ontology, which limits the usefulness of these approaches in practice. In this paper, we propose a computational model that combines data mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), WordNet and a novel class-based n-gram model for automatic ontology discovery and recognition from existing patent documents. A pre-built ontology library was constructed by gathering knowledge from engineering textbooks and dictionaries. Then a data set of engineering patent claims was split into training (80%) and validation (20%) subsets. The pre-built library and WordNet were used to generate class labels for constructing class-based n-gram models in a training process. The holdout validation showed that the average accuracy was 87.26% for all validation samples.",https://openalex.org/W2331855252,2015,Zhen Li; Derrick Tate,Texas Tech University; Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University
Ontology-based dental implant connection patent analysis,"Patent documents consist of well-structured descriptions of the technology innovation and the research results. Patent documents are typically written with specific terminologies which often require the expertise of domain experts to interpret and organize for patent analysis. The rapid growth of number of patents applications and registry increases the difficulty in extracting and synthesizing knowledge from patents. The aim of this paper is to construct a framework of expressing and extracting accurate knowledge from patent documents that are related to dental implant connections. First, domain related patents are collected from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Text mining techniques are used to analyze the key words in the sample set of patents. An ontology is created to express the domain knowledge by using a new ontology engineering technique. In recent years, the aging population has increased the demand for new products and innovations in the dental implant industry. Dental implants are a global, medically accepted treatment used to restore the human masticatory function. The patents collected in the domain of implant connections are used to test the validity and reliability of the ontology development framework. The study of patents related to dental implant connections is considered a critical part of advancing dental implant devices since these designs and innovations are subjected to extensive clinical trials. Given an accurate ontology schema, dental researchers correlate successful prior art designs to successful clinical trials to better understand the interaction between a new artificial body part and the response of the surgical implantation. The value of a patent increases dramatically if the device can be safely used by dentists to treat patients with fewer failures and longer utility.",https://openalex.org/W1974095358,2013,Amy J.C.

Ontology-based technology function matrix for patent analysis of additive manufacturing in the dental industry,"Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have been developed and applied to many domains where product mass-customisation is critical to maintaining competitive advantage. For instance, AM has been adopted for use in the medical and dental manufacture of implants, prosthetics and orthodontics, where these devices must be made to match each patient's unique facial, dental or other body profiles. The research presented focuses on the technological and functional aspects of patent informatics to discover the innovation trends for materials, products, and processes. The research proposes a generic methodology incorporating patent text and data mining to create an ontology based technology function (TF) matrix for any technology domain. The TF matrix is applied to describe the distribution of global dental AM patents. The research compares the latest dental-related AM research initiatives in Taiwan with globally emerging patents.

Computer Supported ontology-based patent analysis considering business processes and strategic patent portfolio management,"Two approaches are frequently used to study the critical technology and market trends of industry. One analyzes the business processes from the market perspective with statistics market survey. The other perspective predicts new technologies from the patent (intellectual property) data. Business process analysis is limited to analyzing existing technologies and market applications. Since the service delivery processes are not frequently linked to the intellectual property of the underlying technologies, applying a patent perspective enables the analysis of technology trends, technology ownership, and royalty payment analysis. These data are used to illustrate the technology life cycles, predict emerging trends, and identify research opportunities with Computer Supported tools. Patent analysis enables the predictions of technology trends but poorly links the technology to actual products for market adoption cause of the large amount of the data. This research develops an innovative computer supported approach for technology analysis combining both market and patent perspectives. The business processes of a given knowledge domain, driven by the market perspective, is analyzed to build the basis of the domain's ontology. Afterward, the key phrases of the business processes are added to form the ontology schema. The related patents are then systematically linked to the business process schema nodes. The research approach enables the business process-oriented patent portfolios among current and potential competitors to be mapped and critically compared from both market performance and technology ownership perspectives. The methodology allows in-depth integrated views of rivals' patenting and business development for strategic R&D management.

An ontology-based interactive tool to search documents in the U.S. patent system,"The past few years have seen an explosive growth in scientific and regulatory documents related to the patent system. Relevant information is siloed into many heterogeneous and distributed information sources making it very challenging to retrieve information across multiple domains. In this demonstration, we present a tool that enables users to simultaneously search multiple information domains in the patent system. The presented tool is built upon the Patent System Ontology, which provides both a standardized representation of the patent system domain and required semantics to integrate the various information domains [1], [2]. The tool provides features such as integration with a biomedical knowledge base and recommendations for related articles. Future additions to the tool will provide features to analyze the data both statistically and visually to aid in research.

Intelligent Text Mining for Ontological Knowledge Graph Refinement and Patent Portfolio Analysis—Case Study of Net-Zero Data Center Innovation Management,"Ontological knowledge graph (OKG) is a well-formed visual representation that depicts knowledge organization in formal elements (e.g., entities and attributes) and their interrelationships. OKG is crucial for innovation management analysis as it provides a clear boundary to understand complex knowledge domain in detail. In the patent analysis field, it facilitates the definition of a well-defined patent portfolio, aiming for accurate and complete patent retrievals and subsequent analyses. In recent decade, the rapid growth of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector has rendered data centers (DCs) indispensable for data processing, storage, and cloud computing, while ensuring security and privacy during DC operations. However, their energy-intensive operations pose challenges to global efforts toward achieving net-zero emissions goals. In response, this research develops a formal OKG refinement process and uses DC net-zero technology OKG as case study for in-depth OKG refinement and application in patent portfolio analysis. The net-zero DC domain covers five sub-technologies. Utilizing the proposed OKG refinement and patent portfolio analysis framework, the 1801 most recent decade’s patents related to relevant “DC net-zero technologies” are retrieved and analyzed.

Recommendation Mechanism for Patent Trading Empowered by Heterogeneous Information Networks,"The emerging patent trading platforms help to ease information asymmetry and trust issues during transaction, but a proactive recommendation mechanism that intelligently helps patent buyers identify relevant patents is still absent in the literature. This study proposes a recommendation mechanism for patent trading empowered by heterogeneous information networks (HIN) that integrates various patent information such as patent trading, patent invention, patent citation, patent ontology, and patent contents. Further, the meta-path-based similarity measure (i.e., AvgSim) is employed to calculate relevance and identify the different motivations of potential buyers in buying patents. We conducted two experiments to examine the performance of a proposed mechanism. An offline experiment on Public PatentsView database and Patent Assignment database show that the HIN-empowered recommendation outperforms baseline methods. We also implemented the proposed mechanism on a real-world trading platform (www.InnoCity.com). The recommendation function achieves satisfying results by tracking users' feedback, which further validates the usability of HIN-empowered recommendation in a patent trading context.",https://openalex.org/W2922665519,2019,Qi Wang; Wei Du; Jian Ma,

Utilization of Bio-Ontologies for Enhancing Patent Information Retrieval,"The ability to access existing patents and patent-related information can have significant impacts on technology development and commercial markets. While such information is now available online, requesting the information about a specific technology remains a nontrivial task. The reason is that the online information often resides in different storage sources, is based on different modeling paradigms, and is managed by different independent entities. Ontology is one modeling paradigm that can capture semantically rich knowledge about a specific domain and its existing patents. That knowledge can be used to facilitate information sharing and information interoperability. This paper focuses on the bio-medical domain, where numerous patents have been filed in recent years. Specifically, this paper describes a computational framework that can facilitate the retrieval of intellectual property (IP-) related information in the biomedical domain.",https://openalex.org/W3124067371,2019,Siddharth Taduri; Kincho H.

Dental implant technology clustering and technology life-span analysis using ontology-based patent intelligence,"Rapid technology development shorter product life cycle, fierce competition in the marketplace, establishes patent analyses are an important strategic tool for R&D management. This thesis develops a technology clustering and life-span analysis framework based on data mining techniques to help companies effectively and rapidly gain domain-specific knowledge and technology insight. In addition, patent documents contain complex terminologies which require experts to perform patent analysis. This research applies patent analysis methodologies to create domain-specific ontologies. The advantage of using an ontology is that it contains specific domain concepts and helps researchers to understand the relationships between concepts. In addition, ontologies are used to effectively extract domain knowledge, cluster patents and create graphs for tend recognition. Life-span analysis of technology clusters helps companies to gain a quick snapshot of their own patent portfolio and identify potential technology clusters for investment. This thesis proposes the process of knowledge extraction for domain-specific patents using patent analysis methodologies which improve domain-knowledge understanding. The methodologies proposed in this research include key phrase analysis, patent technology clustering, patent document clustering, domain-specific ontology, and life-span analysis. With these methodologies, companies quickly derive domain-specific ontologies to help R&D engineers relate data and increase understanding of a specific domain and the relationship between concepts. Life-span analysis helps companies’ direct strategic R&D plans and evaluates the timing of investments using the methodologies proposed in this research.

The system first identifies biological terms and relations from the patents and then integrates the information from the patents with knowledge from biomedical ontologies to create a semantic Web. Besides keyword search and queries linking the properties specified by one or more RDF triples, the system can discover semantic associations between the Web resources. The system also determines the importance of the resources to rank the results of a search and prevent information overload while determining the semantic associations.",https://openalex.org/W2128150950,2005,Sougata Mukherjea; Bhuvan Bamba; Pankaj Kankar,IBM Research - India

An Ontology-based Automatic Semantic Annotation Approach for Patent Document Retrieval in Product Innovation Design,"Patent retrieval plays a very important role in product innovation design. However, current patent retrieval approaches lack semantic comprehension and association, and usually cannot capture the implicit useful knowledge at a semantic level. In order to improve the traditional patent search, this paper proposes a novel ontology-based automatic semantic annotation approach based on the thorough analysis of patent documents, which combines both structure and content characteristics, and integrates multiple techniques from various aspects. Multilayer semantic model is established to realize unified semantic representation. The approach first utilizes template schemes to extract the structure information from patent documents, and then identifies semantics of entities and relations between entities from the content based on natural language processing techniques and domain knowledge, and at last employs a heuristic pattern learning method to abstract patent technical features. Case study is provided to show that our approach can acquire multi-level patent semantic knowledge from multiple perspectives, and discover semantic correlations between patent documents, which can further promote the accurate patent semantic retrieval effectively.",https://openalex.org/W2955644733,2011,Feng Wang; Lanfen Lin; Yang Zhou,Zhejiang University
"PolySearch2: a significantly improved text-mining system for discovering associations between human diseases, genes, drugs, metabolites, toxins and more","PolySearch2 (http://polysearch.ca) is an online text-mining system for identifying relationships between biomedical entities such as human diseases, genes, SNPs, proteins, drugs, metabolites, toxins, metabolic pathways, organs, tissues, subcellular organelles, positive health effects, negative health effects, drug actions, Gene Ontology terms, MeSH terms, ICD-10 medical codes, biological taxonomies and chemical taxonomies. PolySearch2 supports a generalized 'Given X, find all associated Ys' query, where X and Y can be selected from the aforementioned biomedical entities. An example query might be: 'Find all diseases associated with Bisphenol A'. To find its answers, PolySearch2 searches for associations against comprehensive collections of free-text collections, including local versions of MEDLINE abstracts, PubMed Central full-text articles, Wikipedia full-text articles and US Patent application abstracts. PolySearch2 also searches 14 widely used, text-rich biological databases such as UniProt, DrugBank and Human Metabolome Database to improve its accuracy and coverage.

Automated Patent Categorization and Guided Patent Search using IPC as Inspired by MeSH and PubMed,"Document search on PubMed, the pre-eminent database for biomedical literature, relies on the annotation of its documents with relevant terms from the Medical Subject Headings ontology (MeSH) for improving recall through query expansion. Patent documents are another important information source, though they are considerably less accessible. One option to expand patent search beyond pure keywords is the inclusion of classification information: Since every patent is assigned at least one class code, it should be possible for these assignments to be automatically used in a similar way as the MeSH annotations in PubMed. In order to develop a system for this task, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the properties of both classification systems. This report describes our comparative analysis of MeSH and the main patent classification system, the International Patent Classification (IPC). We investigate the hierarchical structures as well as the properties of the terms/classes respectively, and we compare the assignment of IPC codes to patents with the annotation of PubMed documents with MeSH terms.Our analysis shows a strong structural similarity of the hierarchies, but significant differences of terms and annotations. The low number of IPC class assignments and the lack of occurrences of class labels in patent texts imply that current patent search is severely limited. To overcome these limits, we evaluate a method for the automated assignment of additional classes to patent documents, and we propose a system for guided patent search based on the use of class co-occurrence information and external resources.",https://openalex.org/W2123760629,2013,Daniel Eisinger; George Tsatsaronis; Markus Bundschus,Roche Pharma AG (Germany); Technische Universität Dresden
Using Ontology-Based Patent Informatics to Describe the Intellectual Property Portfolio of an E-Commerce Order Fulfillment Process,"Electronic commerce (EC) is the process of selling and buying goods or services through an online platform used for conducting the necessary business communications and transactions for sellers and buyers over the Internet. EC companies sell products online with an emphasis on running the entire supply chain process efficiently. The business processes, that enterprises use to conduct e-commerce business, are quite valuable and can be treated as intellectual properties (IPs). Business method patents provide inventors and enterprises with protection for the unique business process. The United States provides business method patent owners an exclusive IP right for 20 years. A good quality business method patent is considered a powerful and effective tool to generate revenue and bar potential competitors from duplicating the practices. Patent analysis can assist companies in evaluating their business strategies or redesign their business processes. Grouping patent documents and defining a domain ontology helps companies describe technology trends and innovations. This research uses Amazon's business processes as a case example to conduct business method patent analysis, particularly considering order fulfillment as a key method to manage inventory and purchase orders. An EC ontology schema is constructed based on the key EC business processes and key-phrase extraction from the patents. Understanding Amazon's patents and their relationships to the business process, other EC enterprises can examine their own patents' strategic strengths and weaknesses. In addition, they can prevent their business processes not to infringe upon existing EC patents.",https://openalex.org/W2217250717,2015,Abby P. T. Hsu; Charles V. Trappey; Amy J.C.

A Machine Learning Approach for Solar Power Technology Review and Patent Evolution Analysis,"Solar power systems and their related technologies have developed into a globally utilized green energy source. Given the relatively high installation costs, low conversion rates and battery capacity issues, solar energy is still not a widely applied energy source when compared to traditional energy sources. Despite the challenges, there are many innovative studies of new materials and new methods for improving solar energy transformation efficiency to improve the competitiveness of solar energy in the marketplace. This research searches for promising solar power technologies by text mining 2280 global patents and 5610 literature papers of the past decade (January 2008 to June 2018). First, a solar power knowledge ontology schema (or a key term relationship map) is constructed from the comprehensive literature and patent review. Non-supervised machine learning techniques for clustering patents and literature combined with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling algorithm identify sub-technology clusters and their main topics. A word-embedding algorithm is applied to identify the patent documents of the specified technologies. Cross-validation of the results is used to model the technology progress with a patent evolution map. Initial analysis show that many patents focus on solar hydropower storage systems, transferring light generated power to waterpower gravity systems. Batteries are also used but have several limitations. The objectives of this research are to review solar technology development progress and describe the innovation path that has evolved for the solar power domain. By adopting unsupervised learning approaches for literature and patent mining, this research develops a novel technology e-discovery methodology and presents the detailed reviews and analyses of the solar power technology using the proposed e-discovery workflow. The insights of global solar technology development, based on both comprehensive literature and patent reviews and cross-analyses, helps energy companies select advanced technologies related to their key technical R&amp;D strengths and business interests.

Industrial immersive technologies will be used for smart manufacturing innovation in the context of Industry 4.0’s human machine interfaces. This research provides a thorough review of the literature, construction of a domain ontology, presentation of patent metatrend statistical analysis, and data mining analysis using a technology function matrix and highlights technical and functional development trends using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) models. A total of 179 references from the IEEE and IET databases and 2,672 patents are systematically analyzed to identify current trends. The paper establishes an essential foundation for the development of advanced human‐centric cyberphysical systems in complex manufacturing processes.",https://openalex.org/W2788227286,2018,Usharani Hareesh Govindarajan; Amy J.C.

"Clarifying Business Models: Origins, Present, and Future of the Concept","This paper aims to clarify the concept of business models, its usages, and its roles in the Information Systems domain. A review of the literature shows a broad diversity of understandings, usages, and places in the firm. The paper identifies the terminology or ontology used to describe a business model, and compares this terminology with previous work. Then the general usages, roles and potential of the concept are outlined. Finally, the connection between the business model concept and Information Systems is described in the form of eight propositions to be analyzed in future work.",https://openalex.org/W2164314939,2005,Alexander Osterwalder; Yves Pigneur; Christopher L.

Governing through disorder: Neoliberal environmental governance and social theory,"Recent years have witnessed the spread of an array of market-inspired environmental governance approaches, often associated with neoliberal ideas, programs and policies. Drawing on the governmentality framework and focusing on the examples of biotechnology patenting and the financialisation of climate and weather, the article argues that the conceptual underpinnings of these approaches lie in a novel understanding of the ontological quality of the biophysical world. The latter is conceived as fully plastic, controllable, open to an ever-expanding human agency. Neoliberal governance operates through, rather than despite, disorder – that is, through contingency, uncertainty, instability. In the public realm this idea constitutes a sort of shared horizon of meaning; but environmental social theory has a difficult time accounting for it. By reviewing three major perspectives, namely ecological modernization, neo-Marxism and poststructuralism, it is shown that behind contradictions and&#13;\nreticence in their assessments of neoliberal governance lie difficulties in making sense of the latter’s theoretical core. This sets a challenging research program for social theory.",https://openalex.org/W2021386351,2011,Luigi Pellizzoni,University of Trieste
Research on the Construction of Patent Ontology Model in Metallurgy Industry,"Patent literature,which is of great help to scientific researchers,covers most of the new technologies and new methods in the world.In order to change the traditional patent search model and unveil the implicit knowledge in patent literature,it is necessary to reorganize patent information by means of ontology.Taking metallurgy industry as an example,this paper constructs a patent literature ontology model,PATENT_ONTO,with the use of Unified Process for Ontology,and describes the concept model with the use of Protege and OWL coding.",https://openalex.org/W2375810802,2012,Jun Gu,Baogang Group (China)

"Patent pledges, open IP, or patent pools? Developing taxonomies in the thicket of terminologies","Recently, a range of organisations, including car and consumer electronics manufacturers, have applied so-called patent pledges. A patent pledge is a publicly announced intervention by patent-owning entities ('pledgers') to out-license active patents to the restricted or unrestricted public free from or bound to certain conditions for a reasonable or no monetary compensation. Despite growing research to better understand this phenomenon, the underlying terminology remains contradictory. We apply an inductive research approach using qualitative coding to analyse 60 patent pledges made by 80 organisations. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-dimensional taxonomy that distinguishes eight types of patent pledges. Extending this taxonomy using case examples, we then propose a generalised patent licensing taxonomy. This second taxonomy can be used to distinguish patent licensing strategies, including other frequently used approaches, such as patent pools and cross-licenses. Finally, we use the patent pledge taxonomy to illustrate how patent owners change their licensing strategies over time and how it can support strategic decision processes within an organisation. We contribute to the field of patent management by building an ontology of patent pledges through proposing a definition and eight types. The patent licensing taxonomy enables organisations to devise and choose licensing strategies, and to illustrate licensing approaches of competitors, for instance.",https://openalex.org/W2923632057,2019,Jonas Fabian Ehrnsperger; Frank Tietze,University of Cambridge
PubChem Substance and Compound databases,"PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a public repository for information on chemical substances and their biological activities, launched in 2004 as a component of the Molecular Libraries Roadmap Initiatives of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). For the past 11 years, PubChem has grown to a sizable system, serving as a chemical information resource for the scientific research community. PubChem consists of three inter-linked databases, Substance, Compound and BioAssay. The Substance database contains chemical information deposited by individual data contributors to PubChem, and the Compound database stores unique chemical structures extracted from the Substance database. Biological activity data of chemical substances tested in assay experiments are contained in the BioAssay database. This paper provides an overview of the PubChem Substance and Compound databases, including data sources and contents, data organization, data submission using PubChem Upload, chemical structure standardization, web-based interfaces for textual and non-textual searches, and programmatic access. It also gives a brief description of PubChem3D, a resource derived from theoretical three-dimensional structures of compounds in PubChem, as well as PubChemRDF, Resource Description Framework (RDF)-formatted PubChem data for data sharing, analysis and integration with information contained in other databases.",https://openalex.org/W2177317049,2015,Sunghwan Kim; Paul Thiessen; Evan Bolton,National Center for Biotechnology Information; National Institutes of Health
PubChem 2023 update,"Abstract PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a popular chemical information resource that serves a wide range of use cases. In the past two years, a number of changes were made to PubChem. Data from more than 120 data sources was added to PubChem. Some major highlights include: the integration of Google Patents data into PubChem, which greatly expanded the coverage of the PubChem Patent data collection; the creation of the Cell Line and Taxonomy data collections, which provide quick and easy access to chemical information for a given cell line and taxon, respectively; and the update of the bioassay data model. In addition, new functionalities were added to the PubChem programmatic access protocols, PUG-REST and PUG-View, including support for target-centric data download for a given protein, gene, pathway, cell line, and taxon and the addition of the ‘standardize’ option to PUG-REST, which returns the standardized form of an input chemical structure. A significant update was also made to PubChemRDF. The present paper provides an overview of these changes.",https://openalex.org/W4307468223,2022,Sunghwan Kim; Jie Chen; Tiejun Cheng,National Center for Biotechnology Information; National Institutes of Health
The Mutability of Biotechnology Patents,"This article details how patent law works to create discrete, immutable biological ‘objects’. This socio-legal maneuver is necessary to distinguish these artifacts from the unwieldy (and thus unpatentable) realm of the natural world. The creation of ‘objects’ also serves the interests of capital, where a stable, unchanging, immutable object goes hand in hand with commodification. Yet this stabilization is incomplete. Pointing to a variety of different examples, this article illustrates how biotech patents do not speak to specific, immutable things. Biotech patents, rather, are better understood as ontologically fluid (though, as discussed, this fluidity can only occur within limits), which is to say their identity cannot be ‘fixed’ — or, at least, not without undermining the very existence of today’s biotechnology regime. The article concludes by speaking briefly about how this mutability is perpetuating certain inequalities, particularly between holders of various property forms.",https://openalex.org/W2101689569,2010,Michael Carolan,Colorado State University
Patent Analysis of Key Technologies for Smart Retailing and their Projected Economic Impact,"With the growing population of digital users gaining online consumption power, retail industries are facing evolutionary changes in attracting and maintaining online and offline customers. The concepts and implementation of smart malls and retail shops are proposed by retailers or solution providers to satisfy new customer demands. The foundation of smart retailing includes information integration, customer experience, and e-transactions. This research investigates the economic impact of smart retailing and the growth of related intellectual properties (IPs), specifically, the retail domain online related patents. The technological aspect of smart retailing is organized by constructing a patent ontology map to define the domain boundary. The economic impact of technological transformations is studied by measuring the economic growth of the leading regions and countries and the representative patent assignees. Consumption preferences and labor structure changes in relation to the retail industry are analyzed to verify the economic impact of corresponding intellectual properties. The goal of the research is to develop regional development strategies for smart retailing using global patent and economic impact analyses.",https://openalex.org/W2890545420,2018,Amy J.C.

Market Failures and Market Framings: Can a market be transformed from the inside?,"How do actors innovate markets in cases of perceived market failures? This paper’s aim is to examine what happens when a market is innovated or, as we call it, ‘redevised’ in situations where public and commercial interests significantly diverge. Market devices can serve an important function in such attempts to innovate markets: they are material and/or social arrangements that are put into place to shape the market in question in certain ways. But can such devices really transform a market from within? To examine this question we trace the history of the Geneva Medicines Patent Pool, a civil society initiative introduced to change pharmaceutical firms’ licensing and collaboration practices in the market for HIV/AIDS medicines. Our empirical results indicate that redevising a market in response to market failures can shift the market’s frames and contribute to altering its practices, but that this is a pragmatic and often lengthy process that is never fully predictable in advance. By attending to the intended and unintended consequences - or misfires - of redevising a market, our study raises important questions around acting in and on the market, market innovation’s’ ontological impact, zooming in and zooming out when studying redevising, and attending to the temporality of market innovation.",https://openalex.org/W2745634018,2017,Susi Geiger; Nicole Gross,University College Dublin; Dublin City University
