On A Patent Analysis Method for Technological Convergence,"An important feature in recent innovation trend is the merging and overlapping of technologies, i.e. the technological convergence. The paper proposes two approaches using patent data to examine the technological convergence. First, we conduct a patent network analysis using the patent citation, which can be considered as a knowledge flow among technological fields. Second, in order for more specific analysis, the co-classification among technologies is carried out to measure the convergence intensity, rate, and coverage. Finally, by using the coverage intensity and rate, we propose two portfolio matrices to manage the technological convergence.",https://openalex.org/W2056043035,2012
Investigation of forward citation count as a patent analysis method,"Patent citation counts have been used extensively as a patent valuation technique because the information necessary for conducting analysis can be easily gathered and applied to mathematical models. Dominant theory asserts that patents with higher forward citation counts have greater economic value relative to other patents. We focus on evaluating the validity of the patent citation count theory. Three hypotheses that examine the relationship of forward citations with other aspects of patents are presented. In these hypothesis, three relationships are examined: the relationship between a patent's forward citation count and the average number of forward citations for patents in its innovation space, the size of the patent's portfolio, and the patent's second generation forward citation counts. While most of the results proved to be inconclusive, we found evidence that use of forward citations may be problematic.",https://openalex.org/W2163897044,2003
Regression Analysis of Count Data,"Students in both social and natural sciences often seek regression methods to explain the frequency of events, such as visits to a doctor, auto accidents, or new patents awarded. This book, now in its second edition, provides the most comprehensive and up-to-date account of models and methods to interpret such data. The authors combine theory and practice to make sophisticated methods of analysis accessible to researchers and practitioners working with widely different types of data and software in areas such as applied statistics, econometrics, marketing, operations research, actuarial studies, demography, biostatistics and quantitative social sciences. The new material includes new theoretical topics, an updated and expanded treatment of cross-section models, coverage of bootstrap-based and simulation-based inference, expanded treatment of time series, multivariate and panel data, expanded treatment of endogenous regressors, coverage of quantile count regression, and a new chapter on Bayesian methods.",https://openalex.org/W1973628995,2013
Identifying Technological Trends: A Patent Analysis Method for Technology Forecasting,"Patents are extensive and reliable sources of data on technological inventions, serving as the basis for patent analysis tasks. Among these tasks, technology forecasting is essential for research, development and decision-making in organizations. This paper proposes a decision-making support method capable of identifying technological trends. To achieve this, we explore the learning of network representations by applying link prediction algorithms to identify potential trends in the links between technologies. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments in the field of carbon technology. Our link prediction model reached a mean performance of 0.91, considering the ROC-AUC metric.",https://openalex.org/W4403823726,2024

Text Mining and Social Network Analysis-based Patent Analysis Method for Improving Collaboration and Technology Transfer between University and Industry,"Today, according to the increased importance of industry-university cooperation in the knowledge-based economy, support and the number of researches involved in industry- university cooperation has also steadily increased. But it is true that profits from the outcome of patents resulting from such cooperation, such as technology transfer and royalty fees, are lower than they are supposed to be, because of excessive patents applications, although some of them have little commercial potential. Therefore, this research aims to suggest a way to analyze and recognize patents, which enable efficient industry-university cooperation  and technology transfer. For the analysis, data on 1,061 patents was collected from 4 different universities. With the data, a quality-strategy matrix was arranged targeting the industry- university cooperation foundations’, US patents owned by universities, text mining, and social network analysis were carried out, particularly focusing on the patents in the advanced quality technology section of the matrix. Then core key words and IPC codes were obtained and key patents were analyzed by universities. As a result of the analysis, it was found that 4 key patents, 2 key IPC codes were drawn for University H, 4 key patents, 2 key IPC codes for University K, 6 key patents, 1 key IPC code for University Y, 14 key patents, and 2 key IPC codes for University S. This research is expected to have a great significance in contributing to the invigoration of industry-university cooperation based on the analysis result on patents and IPC codes, which enable efficient industry-university cooperation and technology transfer.",https://openalex.org/W3096840521,2017
A patent analysis method for identifying core technologies: Data mining and multi-criteria decision making approach,"This study suggests new approach to identify core technologies through patent analysis. Specially, the approach applied data mining technique and multi-criteria decision making method to the co-classification information of registered patents. First, technological interrelationship matrices of intensity, relatedness, and cross-impact perspectives are constructed with support, lift and confidence values calculated by conducting an association rule mining on the co-classification information of patent data. Second, the analytic network process is applied to the constructed technological interrelationship matrices in order to produce the importance values of technologies from each perspective. Finally, data envelopment analysis is employed to the derived importance values in order to identify priorities of technologies, putting three perspectives together. It is expected that suggested approach could help technology planners to formulate strategy and policy for technological innovation.",https://openalex.org/W2334152323,2014
Pinpointing Industrial Invention: An Exploration of Quantitative Methods for the Analysis of Patents,"In the course of animated debates, specialists have slowly come to recognise that the study of patents can provide a limited but irreplaceable contribution to the knowledge of technical change.1 Our aim in this chapter is not to discuss the general worth of this sort of study but rather to explore the use of co-word analysis to improve the study of the contents of a large number of patents.",https://openalex.org/W2492477040,1986
A hybrid-strategy method combining semantic analysis with rule-based MT for patent machine translation,"This paper presents a hybrid method combining semantic analysis with rule-based MT for patent machine translation. Based on the theory of Hierarchical Network of Concepts, the semantic analysis used the lv principle to deal with the ambiguity of multiple verbs and the boundary of long NP. The determination of main verb can help to select the right syntax tree, and the boundary detection of long NP can help to schedule the process of syntax. From the result of the experiments, we can see that this hybrid-strategy method can effectively improve the performance of Chinese-English patent machine translation.",https://openalex.org/W1985169909,2010
Constructing an Intelligent Patent Network Analysis Method,"Patent network analysis, an advanced method of patent analysis, is a useful tool for technology management. This method visually displays all the relationships among the patents and enables the analysts to intuitively comprehend the overview of a set of patents in the field of the technology being studied. Although patent network analysis possesses relative advantages different from traditional methods of patent analysis, it is subject to several crucial limitations. To overcome the drawbacks of the current method, this study proposes a novel patent analysis method, called the intelligent patent network analysis method, to make a visual network with great precision. Based on artificial intelligence techniques, the proposed method provides an automated procedure for searching patent documents, extracting patent keywords, and determining the weight of each patent keyword in order to generate a sophisticated visualization of the patent network. This study proposes a detailed procedure for generating an intelligent patent network that is helpful for improving the efficiency and quality of patent analysis. Furthermore, patents in the field of Carbon Nanotube Backlight Unit (CNT-BLU) were analyzed to verify the utility of the proposed method.",https://openalex.org/W2029646946,2012
How business methods accompany technological innovations – a case study using semantic patent analysis and a novel informetric measure,"Usually, the development of a technology interacts with the development of business methods, which are needed to enter the application fields. For some years now, it is possible to analyse their interaction as, next to technological innovations, business method innovations can be patented. To investigate this interplay, we select the case of radio frequency identification devices (RFID) – a technology that first emerged many years ago, but is still undergoing further development. We analyse approximately 37,000 patents related to RFID technology from the period between 1990 and 2014, differentiating between technological and business method patents, by means of bibliographic and semantic analyses, using one well established and one novel informetric measure. Contrary to our expectations, the results point to technological innovations that are not ensued but constantly accompanied by business methods. Furthermore, we identify two types of players, that is technology and application specialists. There is a clear distinction between these two types, though all companies of both types apply for technological as well as business method patents. As our semantic analysis reveals, RFID were successively introduced in their application fields between 1998 and 2008, starting with industrial applications, and then moving on to service applications. In future, technology managers should develop strategies based on the interaction between technological and business method patents, keeping in mind the early start and sequential development of different application fields.",https://openalex.org/W2779814565,2017
Comparison and Analysis of Embedding Methods for Patent Documents,"Patent text mining is an important task that requires domain knowledge. The patent text is sometimes not clear and contains many ambiguous and technical words. Traditional text mining approaches are not satisfactory enough for patent text mining. In this paper, we consider various embedding techniques for patent documents and try to find how to represent the patent text for other downstream tasks such as patent classification, patent recommendation, finding similar patents, knowledge mining, etc. We compare several embedding approaches with the patent classification task. The experimental results demonstrate that using contextual word embeddings can perform better than the conventional static word embedding approaches.",https://openalex.org/W3134304334,2021
New Procedure for Quantitative Elemental Analysis by Laser-Induced Plasma Spectroscopy,"A new procedure, based on the laser-induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS) technique, is proposed for calibration-free quantitative elemental analysis of materials. The method here presented, based on an algorithm developed and patented by IFAM-CNR, allows the matrix effects to be overcome, yielding precise and accurate quantitative results on elemental composition of materials without use of calibration curves. Some applications of the method are illustrated, for quantitative analysis of the composition of metallic alloys and quantitative determination of the composition of the atmosphere.",https://openalex.org/W2132355204,1999
Comparative analysis of the diagnostic value of several methods for the diagnosis of patent foramen ovale,"Abstract The aim of this research was to compare the sensitivity and positive predictive value of contrast transcranial Doppler (c‐TCD), contrast transthoracic echocardiography (c‐TTE), and contrast transesophageal echocardiography (c‐TEE), to determine the best method for diagnosing patent foramen ovale (PFO) and to provide a reference for the further improvement of clinical practice. We investigated 161 patients who suffered from migraines, cryptogenic stroke, TIA, and cerebral infarction of unknown cause. All patients underwent transcatheter examination, and the results of the right heart catheterization (RHC) were considered the gold standard for PFO diagnosis. The present study revealed that c‐TTE with the Valsalva maneuver had a higher sensitivity in detecting PFO related right‐to‐left shunt (PFO‐RLS), c‐TCD performed similarly to c‐TEE but maybe produce more false positives. Moreover, when we observed color shunt from the slit‐like channel between the septum primum and the septum secundum on TEE, the positive predictive value was the highest. Patients with suspected PFO should be examined with c‐TTE and c‐TEE for confirmation. When there were a large number of bubbles in the left heart, especially in the presence of color shunt, the positive predictive value was the highest. The positive results of c‐TCD only point out the presence of right‐to‐left shunt and cannot exclude extracardiac shunt, so c‐TCD should not be used as a screen for PFO, additional measures such as c‐TTE and c‐TEE should be used.",https://openalex.org/W3153327640,2021

Computer Vision Methods for Parkinsonian Gait Analysis: A Review on Patents,"Gait disturbance is an important symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). This paper presents a review of patents reported in the area of computerized gait disorder analysis. The feasibility of marker-less vision based systems has been examined for 'at-home' self-evaluation of gait taking into account the physical restrictions of patients arising due to PD. A three tier review methodology has been utilized to synthesize gait applications to investigate PD related gait features and to explore methods for gait classification based on symptom severities. A comparison between invasive and non-invasive methods for gait analysis revealed that marker-free approach can provide resource efficient, convenient and accurate gait measurements through the use of image processing methods. Image segmentation of human silhouette is the major challenge in the marker-free systems which can possibly be comprehended through the use of Microsoft Kinect application and motion estimation algorithms. Our synthesis further suggests that biorhythmic features in gait patterns have potential to discriminate gait anomalies based on the clinical scales.

A novel method of IP R&amp;D using patent analysis and expert survey,"Intellectual property research and development (IP R&amp;D) is an essential condition in order to be more competitive in the rapidly changing global market environment. The ultimate objective of IP R&amp;D is technology forecasting. Technology forecasting (TF) attempts to discover the future state of a technology. Many quantitative and qualitative TF-related research efforts currently exist. Expert survey is a qualitative forecasting method; expert survey technology forecasting (ESTF) is one of many TF methods. The goal of ESTF is to predict the future state of a target technology using expert survey. Although ESTF has many advantages, it is less stable than other quantitative TF methods such as patent analysis because ESTF is subjectively based on the knowledge of experts. It is obvious that quantitative approaches such as patent analysis also have limitations. One of these limitations is the need for the experience of domain experts for the interpretation of patent analysis results. In this paper we propose a patent analysis approach that improves the performance of ESTF. Our approach combines patent analysis with the expert survey forecasting method to improve the predictive effectiveness of ESTF. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated by means of a case study involving TF work related to web survey technology.",https://openalex.org/W2205700617,2015
A Disruptive Technology Identification Method for New Power Systems Based on Patent Evolution Analysis,"Disruptive technologies have been employed in various fields with a strategic priority in several countries as the core driving force of the fourth industrial revolution, significantly impacting the development of new power systems. It is a kernel to effectively identify the future potential of disruptive technologies. To overcome the subjectivity and limitations of existing disruptive technology identification methods, we propose a disruptive technology identification method based on patent evolution analysis. Firstly, the evolution matrix of the patent data is calculated. Afterward, we dig into the characteristics of disruptive technologies to build a more targeted identification index system. Finally, the fields of electric power communication and energy generation are selected as typical cases to build the patent data sets. The future development of the identified technologies, including the identified quantum technologies and controlled fusion, is analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can identify the key technologies of new power systems accurately and contribute to completing the industrial upgrading and transformation more rapidly.",https://openalex.org/W4367310904,2023

Prediction of Difficult Mask Ventilation,"Background Maintenance of airway patency and oxygenation are the main objectives of face-mask ventilation. Because the incidence of difficult mask ventilation (DMV) and the factors associated with it are not well known, we undertook this prospective study. Methods Difficult mask ventilation was defined as the inability of an unassisted anesthesiologist to maintain the measured oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry &gt; 92% or to prevent or reverse signs of inadequate ventilation during positive-pressure mask ventilation under general anesthesia. A univariate analysis was performed to identify potential factors predicting DMV, followed by a multivariate analysis, and odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated. Results A total of 1,502 patients were prospectively included. DMV was reported in 75 patients (5%; 95% confidence interval, 3.9-6.1%), with one case of impossible ventilation. DMV was anticipated by the anesthesiologist in only 13 patients (17% of the DMV cases). Body mass index, age, macroglossia, beard, lack of teeth, history of snoring, increased Mallampati grade, and lower thyromental distance were identified in the univariate analysis as potential DMV risk factors. Using a multivariate analysis, five criteria were recognized as independent factors for a DMV (age older than 55 yr, body mass index &gt; 26 kg/m2, beard, lack of teeth, history of snoring), the presence of two indicating high likelihood of DMV (sensitivity, 0.72; specificity, 0.73). Conclusion In a general adult population, DMV was reported in 5% of the patients. A simple DMV risk score was established. Being able to more accurately predict DMV may improve the safety of airway management.",https://openalex.org/W2104037964,2000
A prospective randomised study of “covered” versus “uncovered” diamond stents for the management of distal malignant biliary obstruction,"Background and aim: Covered self-expandable metal stents (EMS) were recently developed to overcome tumour ingrowth in conventional EMS. However, supporting evidence for the efficacy of covered EMS is lacking. Patients and methods: We enrolled 112 patients with unresectable distal biliary malignancies. They were randomly assigned to polyurethane covered (n = 57) or original diamond stent (n = 55). Results: Stent occlusion occurred in eight patients (14%) after a mean of 304 days in the covered group, and in 21 patients (38%) after a mean of 166 days in the uncovered group. The incidence of covered EMS occlusion was significantly lower than that of uncovered EMS (p = 0.0032). The cumulative stent patency of covered stents was significantly higher than that of uncovered stents (p = 0.0066). No tumour ingrowth occurred in the covered group while it was observed in 15 patients in the uncovered group. In subgroup analysis, the cumulative patency of the covered EMS was significantly higher in pancreatic cancer (p = 0.0363) and metastatic lymph nodes (p = 0.0354). There was no significant difference in survival between the two groups. Acute cholecystitis was observed in two of the covered group and in none of the uncovered group. Mild pancreatitis occurred in five of the covered group and in one of the uncovered group. Conclusions: Covered diamond stents successfully prevented tumour ingrowth and were significantly superior to uncovered stents for the treatment of patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction. However, careful attention must be paid to complications specific to covered self-expandable metal stents, such as acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis.",https://openalex.org/W2105725898,2004
Numerical Patent Analysis with the Fuzzy Pay-Off Method: Valuing a Compound Real Option,Numerical analysis for Supporting patent application decisions is a difficult topic due to hardship in estimating the patent future accurately and because patent valuation is most often a problem with multiple stages that can be understood as compound options. We present how numerical analysis of patent exhibiting two major stages can be done by using cash-flow scenarios as input data and a two-stage valuation model based on the fuzzy pay-off method for real option valuation to generate decision-support for deciding whether to go ahead with a patent application or not. We illustrate with a numerical example and discuss the use of the results in decision-support.,https://openalex.org/W2013140146,2011
Exploring Knowledge Trajectories of Accounting Information Systems Using Business Method Patents and Knowledge Persistence-Based Main Path Analysis,"In this paper, the development trajectory of accounting information systems was analyzed using business method patents and main path analysis based on knowledge persistence. Knowledge persistence-based main path analysis can dramatically minimize the complexity of a knowledge network without omission of the dominant knowledge flows, and so it is a suitable selection for analyzing the business method patents on accounting information systems. The main findings from the empirical results are as follows: the empirical results show that accounting information system patents were developed along with the software patent of knowledge injected from the outside. Bookkeeping/accounting and taxation systems expanded from the basic calculation, storage, and payment technique to scalability to other techniques and functions in more complex situations. This research has found that technological advancement has facilitated and been supporting the development of accounting information system over the years, as shown in the patents filed under business solutions. There is a clear indication of the growing complexity of those patents, signifying the moves/advancement of corporate business information systems from financial accounting-oriented systems to more complex ERP systems.",https://openalex.org/W4296280624,2022

Patent Foramen Ovale Is an Important Predictor of Adverse Outcome in Patients With Major Pulmonary Embolism,"Background —Right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale is frequently diagnosed by contrast echocardiography and can be particularly prominent in the presence of elevated pressures in the right side of the heart. Its prognostic significance in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism, however, is unknown. Methods and Results —The present prospective study included 139 consecutive patients with major pulmonary embolism diagnosed on the basis of clinical, echocardiographic, and cardiac catheterization criteria. All patients underwent contrast echocardiography at presentation. The end points of the study were overall mortality and complicated clinical course during the hospital stay defined as death, cerebral or peripheral arterial thromboembolism, major bleeding, or need for endotracheal intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Patent foramen ovale was diagnosed in 48 patients (35%). These patients had a death rate of 33% as opposed to 14% in patients with a negative echo-contrast examination ( P =.015). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the only independent predictors of mortality in the study population were a patent foramen ovale (odds ratio [OR], 11.4; P &lt;.001) and arterial hypotension at presentation (OR, 26.3; P &lt;.001). Patients with a patent foramen ovale also had a significantly higher incidence of ischemic stroke (13% versus 2.2%; P =.02) and peripheral arterial embolism (15 versus 0%; P &lt;.001). Overall, the risk of a complicated in-hospital course was 5.2 times higher in this patient group ( P &lt;.001). Conclusions —In patients with major pulmonary embolism, echocardiographic detection of a patent foramen ovale signifies a particularly high risk of death and arterial thromboembolic complications.",https://openalex.org/W1996930100,1998

Nitinol Stent Implantation Versus Balloon Angioplasty for Lesions in the Superficial Femoral Artery and Proximal Popliteal Artery,"Background— Controversy still exists regarding the best endovascular treatment strategy for patients with symptomatic disease of the superficial femoral artery. There are conflicting data regarding the benefits of superficial femoral artery stenting and the role of primary stenting compared with balloon angioplasty with provisional stent implantation. Methods and Results— A total of 206 patients from 24 centers in the United States and Europe with obstructive lesions of the superficial femoral artery and proximal popliteal artery and intermittent claudication were randomized to implantation of nitinol stents or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The mean total lesion length was 71 mm for the stent group and 64 mm for the angioplasty group. Acute lesion success (&lt;30%residual stenosis) was superior for the stent group compared with the angioplasty group (95.8% versus 83.9%; P &lt;0.01). Twenty-nine (40.3%) patients in the angioplasty group underwent bailout stenting because of a suboptimal angiographic result or flow-limiting dissection. Bailout stenting was treated as a target lesion revascularization and loss of primary patency in the final analysis. At 12 months, freedom from target lesion revascularization was 87.3% for the stent group compared with 45.1% for the angioplasty group ( P &lt;0.0001). Duplex ultrasound-derived primary patency at 12 months was better for the stent group (81.3% versus 36.7%; P &lt;0.0001). Through 12 months, fractures occurred in 3.1% of stents implanted. No stent fractures resulted in loss of patency or target lesion revascularization. Conclusions— In this multicenter trial, primary implantation of a self-expanding nitinol stent for moderate-length lesions in the superficial femoral artery and proximal popliteal artery was associated with better acute angiographic results and improved patency compared with balloon angioplasty alone.

Context–Problem Network and Quantitative Method of Patent Analysis: A Case Study of Wireless Energy Transmission Technology,"Identification of prevalent problems is an important process of strategic innovation for stakeholders of trending technologies. This paper proposes a systematic and replicable method of patent analysis to identify problems to be solved requisite for sustainable technology planning and development, by implementing the concept of ‘context’ to facilitate problem identification. The main concept of the method entails the importance of the connections between contextual information and problems to provide more focused, relevant, and constructive insights essential for instating goals for research and development activities. These context–problem entities and their entwined connections are discovered using keyword pattern matching, grammar-based text mining, and co-word analysis techniques. The intermediary outputs are then utilized to generate the proposed context–problem network (CP net) for social network, grammar, and quantitative data analysis. For verification, our method was applied to 737 patents in the wireless energy transmission technology domain, successfully yielding CP net data. The detailed analysis of the resulting CP net data delivered meaningful information in the wireless charging technology field: The main contexts, “batteries”, “power transmission coils”, and “cores”, are found to be most relevant to the main problems, “maximizing coupling efficiency”, “minimizing DC signal components”, and “charging batteries”. The results provide a wide range of informative perspectives for individuals, the scientific community, corporate, and market-level stakeholders. Furthermore, the method of this study can be applicable to various technologies since it is independent of specific subject domains. Future research directions aim to improve this method for better quality and modeling of contexts and problems.",https://openalex.org/W2922207572,2019

Data from a dedicated online market survey conducted to identify the most relevant technologies, presented here for the first time, shows that FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) respectively Flow cytometry (33% usage), laser microdissection (17%), manual cell picking (17%), random seeding/dilution (15%), and microfluidics/lab-on-a-chip devices (12%) are currently the most frequently used technologies. These most prominent technologies are described in detail and key performance factors are discussed. The survey data indicates a further increasing interest in single-cell isolation tools for the coming years. Additionally, a worldwide patent search was performed to screen for emerging technologies that might become relevant in the future. In total 179 patents were found, out of which 25 were evaluated by screening the title and abstract to be relevant to the field.",https://openalex.org/W1762951073,2015

METHODS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF CYBER RISKS: AN ANALYSIS BASED ON PATENT DATA,"The problem of fast-rising cyber-risks become very important in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Cyber-risks cause not only high losses but also break the chain of economic relations between companies and their customers. Besides, cyber risks change their form and structure rapidly, so the tools of risk management must be adequate. That is why the problem of cyber-risk identification and assessment has gotten attention and become so actual. The purpose of this study is to outline new approaches to identifying and estimating cyber-risks based on the dates of the World International Property Organization (WIPO). In order to conduct our study, we will use various tools and techniques such as: citation analysis, cluster analysis, and visualization. We have analyzed the patent information from the groups of “Electric digital data processing”, “Transmission of digital information” and data processing systems or methods, specially adapted for financial purposes. In our findings, we analyze the technical and economic significance of patents.Our work has led us to conclude that the number of methods of cyber risk identification that were the objects of applications granted by WIPO has a strong connection with the number of cyber-attacks from 2010 to 2017. That is why the innovative methods that were granted have a wide spectrum of influence and could be used in different stages of risk management. We selected patents that based on cyber risk identification and assessment from the data of WIPO and divided these patents into clusters. This helps us in understanding the trends and characters of innovative activities directed to successful management of cyber risks.",https://openalex.org/W2899737333,2018
A study on technology visualization analysis method using patent classifier,"Abstract In this paper, we propose an efficient method of technical structure analysis of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) development using network analysis. Recently, with the reform of the industrial structure called “Industry 4.0″ and the explosive expansion of the application area of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the demand for computing power in edge devices is increasing. For these backgrounds, the acceleration by FPGA is focused on the industry. Hence, in this paper, we analyze the technology development trends of a significant FPGA supplier. As analytical data, we employ patents obtained by the company in the U.S. We focus on the classifiers in the patent information. We create graphs by classifiers and analyze their clusters. From the results of extracting graph features by the proposed method, key technology areas and their transitions are revealed in the technology development of FPGA suppliers.",https://openalex.org/W3104909791,2020
Safety and Efficacy of Mechanical Embolectomy in Acute Ischemic Stroke,"Background and Purpose— The only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) given intravenously within 3 hours of symptom onset. An alternative strategy for opening intracranial vessels during stroke is mechanical embolectomy, especially for patients ineligible for intravenous tPA. Methods— We investigated the safety and efficacy of a novel embolectomy device (Merci Retriever) to open occluded intracranial large vessels within 8 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms in a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter trial. All patients were ineligible for intravenous tPA. Primary outcomes were recanalization and safety, and secondary outcomes were neurological outcome at 90 days in recanalized versus nonrecanalized patients. Results— Recanalization was achieved in 46% (69/151) of patients on intention to treat analysis, and in 48% (68/141) of patients in whom the device was deployed. This rate is significantly higher than that expected using an historical control of 18% ( P &lt;0.0001). Clinically significant procedural complications occurred in 10 of 141 (7.1%) patients. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages was observed in 11 of 141 (7.8%) patients. Good neurological outcomes (modified Rankin score ≤2) were more frequent at 90 days in patients with successful recanalization compared with patients with unsuccessful recanalization (46% versus 10%; relative risk [RR], 4.4; 95% CI, 2.1 to 9.3; P &lt;0.0001), and mortality was less (32% versus 54%; RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.89; P =0.01). Conclusions— A novel endovascular embolectomy device can significantly restore vascular patency during acute ischemic stroke within 8 hours of stroke symptom onset and provides an alternative intervention for patients who are otherwise ineligible for thrombolytics.",https://openalex.org/W2138411396,2005
Analysis of Patent Application Attention: A Network Analysis Method,"Patent is an important embodiment of innovation. Before patent application, many people will check a patent application process on the Internet to understand the steps of a patent application. In fact, these people’s search is also a means to understand whether innovative enterprises or individuals imply the importance of innovation. It has become a new crucial problem to obtain more information about time-series data. Research has found that the concept of VG can provide deeper information in time-series data so that it can understand the information of patent applications more comprehensively. After analyzing the data from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2018, we find: i) there are very few peaks and valleys, and 80% of searches are in the normal range. ii) according to the central value of the ranking, it can be found that the peaks of the annual patent application search times time series occurred in December last year, after January, February of this year or after August-October, and iii) after clustering the time series data, we find that the attention of people shows noticeable segmentation effect.",https://openalex.org/W4282839872,2022
Carotid Artery Stenosis: Gray-Scale and Doppler US Diagnosis—Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Consensus Conference,"The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts in the field of vascular ultrasonography (US) to come to a consensus regarding Doppler US for assistance in the diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis. The panel's consensus statement is believed to represent a reasonable position on the basis of analysis of available literature and panelists' experience. Key elements of the statement include the following: (a) All internal carotid artery (ICA) examinations should be performed with gray-scale, color Doppler, and spectral Doppler US. (b) The degree of stenosis determined at gray-scale and Doppler US should be stratified into the categories of normal (no stenosis), <50% stenosis, 50%-69% stenosis, > or =70% stenosis to near occlusion, near occlusion, and total occlusion. (c) ICA peak systolic velocity (PSV) and presence of plaque on gray-scale and/or color Doppler images are primarily used in diagnosis and grading of ICA stenosis; two additional parameters, ICA-to-common carotid artery PSV ratio and ICA end-diastolic velocity may also be used when clinical or technical factors raise concern that ICA PSV may not be representative of the extent of disease. (d) ICA should be diagnosed as (i) normal when ICA PSV is less than 125 cm/sec and no plaque or intimal thickening is visible; (ii) <50% stenosis when ICA PSV is less than 125 cm/sec and plaque or intimal thickening is visible; (iii) 50%-69% stenosis when ICA PSV is 125-230 cm/sec and plaque is visible; (iv) > or =70% stenosis to near occlusion when ICA PSV is greater than 230 cm/sec and visible plaque and lumen narrowing are seen; (v) near occlusion when there is a markedly narrowed lumen at color Doppler US; and (vi) total occlusion when there is no detectable patent lumen at gray-scale US and no flow at spectral, power, and color Doppler US. (e) The final report should discuss velocity measurements and gray-scale and color Doppler findings. Study limitations should be noted when they exist. The conclusion should state an estimated degree of ICA stenosis as reflected in the above categories. The panel also considered various technical aspects of carotid US and methods for quality assessment and identified several important unanswered questions meriting future research.",https://openalex.org/W2101559592,2003
Failure of Ductus Arteriosus Closure Is Associated With Increased Mortality in Preterm Infants,"OBJECTIVE. Because the standard of care has been to attempt to close the patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates, there is a paucity of information on the outcome of patients with a persistent patent ductus arteriosus. Our objective was to compare the mortality of preterm infants with and without a persistent patent ductus arteriosus. METHODS. This was a single-center, retrospective study. Very preterm infants (birth weight ≤ 1500 g and gestational age ≤ 29 weeks) who survived beyond the first 3 postnatal days and did not undergo surgical ligation were included in the primary analysis. Mortality of neonates with a persistent and a closed patent ductus arteriosus was compared during the initial hospitalization by using the χ2 test. Cox proportional hazard regression and logistic regression were used to take into account the time until death and assess the independent effect of each risk factor on mortality. We also performed 3 secondary analyses by excluding patients who died during the first 7 and 14 postnatal days and including patients who underwent surgical ligation by using different group assignments. A persistent patent ductus arteriosus was defined as a failure of either spontaneous or pharmacologic ductal closure during the initial hospitalization. RESULTS. Patients with a persistent patent ductus arteriosus (n = 41) had lower birth weight and were less mature than those with a closed ductus (n = 260). Unadjusted mortality rate was higher in patients with a persistent (70.7%) than with a closed (11.2%) ductus. After adjustment for perinatal factors, level of maturity, disease severity, and morbid pathologies, the hazard for death in neonates with a persistent ductus was eightfold higher than in those with a closed ductus. Exclusion of patients who died during the first 2 weeks or inclusion of those who underwent ductal ligation did not change the findings. CONCLUSION. Failure of ductal closure is associated with an increase in mortality in very preterm infants.",https://openalex.org/W2025687321,2008

Circular Economy Innovation and Environmental Sustainability Impact on Economic Growth: An Integrated Model for Sustainable Development,"This study examines the link between selected indicators of a circular economy, including essential components of environmental and economic growth. Developed economies are continuously innovating to promote growth and giving governmental support to the producers to move from linear economies to circular ones. Hence, waste materials in industrial systems are recycled or re-used, improving the efficiency of using finite resources with the no-waste approach. The aim of this paper is the following: (1) to identify the main components of a circular economy, which are also supportive of sustainability and development; (2) to check the impact of these variables in the economic growth of European Union countries; (3) to find out if the three components of sustainable development adopted to circular economy (CE) indicators (environmental–social–economic) are significant to economic growth. We used a fixed effect panel data analysis to identify the circular economy’s impact on the economic growth of European countries. Additionally, to support the results of the regression analysis, we employed a second method—generalized methods of moments—computing the Arellano–Bond dynamic panel data estimation method. The model included five independent variables, such as environmental tax rate, a recycling rate of waste, private investment and jobs in a circular economy, patents related to recycling, and trade of recyclable raw materials. The identification of each variable was made based on a deep search through literature. The results of both econometric models showed a strong and positive correlation between a circular economy to economic growth, highlighting the crucial role of sustainability, innovation, and investment in no-waste initiatives to promote wealth.",https://openalex.org/W3034307058,2020
Prenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta improves survival and reduces morbidity: Table 1,"Objective: To investigate whether antenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta results in reduced mortality and improved preoperative haemodynamic stability compared with postnatal diagnosis. Design: Retrospective review of all cases of coarctation of the aorta presenting to a tertiary fetal and neonatal cardiology service from January 1994 to December 1998. Methods: Prenatal, postnatal, and necropsy records were reviewed to determine survival in the two groups. Markers of preoperative illness severity were recorded, including presence of femoral pulse, collapse, left ventricular function, ductal patency on echocardiography, coagulation status, duration of intensive care unit and total hospital stay, heart rate, respiratory rate, plasma creatinine, plasma potassium, and right upper limb blood pressure. A univarate and multivariate analysis was conducted on all variables and a cumulative score was created and subjected to logistic regression analysis. Results: Both collapse and death were more common in the postnatally diagnosed group (p &lt; 0.05). Femoral pulses were more likely to be palpable and there was echocardiographic evidence of duct patency in the antenatally diagnosed infants (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). An increased respiratory rate was associated with postnatal presentation (p &lt; 0.05). Infants with haemodynamic instability preoperatively were more likely to have been diagnosed postnatally (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Antenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta is associated with improved survival and preoperative clinical condition.",https://openalex.org/W2151237047,2002
Green technology innovation development in China in 1990–2015,"Patent data present a number of advantages compared to other alternative measures of innovation. This paper presents research on the use of environmentally relevant technology patent data using a comprehensive analysis method to analyze the development of green technology innovation in China in 1990-2015. From the analysis, it can be concluded that during the period of 2000-2015, China's environmental-related technology innovation made great progress and was at the forefront of green technology growth; in particular, the areas of water and wastewater treatment, solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, lighting, improvements related to bulk or fine chemicals or pharmaceuticals, electric vehicles, and other technologies made great achievements. These technologies are closely related to environmental policies, such as climate change mitigation and green industry transformation, for which China has been advocating for more than a decade. However, after analyzing China's green development, it was found that, although some of the indicators, environmental-related patents, and green developments have made great progress, complete reliance on green technology is far off in the future.",https://openalex.org/W2969431724,2019
TTD: <i>Therapeutic Target Database</i> describing target druggability information,"Abstract Target discovery is one of the essential steps in modern drug development, and the identification of promising targets is fundamental for developing first-in-class drug. A variety of methods have emerged for target assessment based on druggability analysis, which refers to the likelihood of a target being effectively modulated by drug-like agents. In the therapeutic target database (TTD), nine categories of established druggability characteristics were thus collected for 426 successful, 1014 clinical trial, 212 preclinical/patented, and 1479 literature-reported targets via systematic review. These characteristic categories were classified into three distinct perspectives: molecular interaction/regulation, human system profile and cell-based expression variation. With the rapid progression of technology and concerted effort in drug discovery, TTD and other databases were highly expected to facilitate the explorations of druggability characteristics for the discovery and validation of innovative drug target.

Combination Therapy With Abciximab Reduces Angiographically Evident Thrombus in Acute Myocardial Infarction,"Background —Use of abciximab in combination with administration of thrombolytics has been shown to improve epicardial and microvascular coronary blood flow in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). As a potential mechanism, we hypothesized that combination therapy would reduce angiographically evident thrombus (AET) and would increase lumen diameter compared with thrombolytic monotherapy. Methods and Results —Patients who received combination therapy in TIMI 14 (low-dose thrombolytic plus abciximab, n=732) were compared with patients who received thrombolytic monotherapy without abciximab in the TIMI 4, 10A, 10B, and 14 trials (n=1662). Thrombus burden was assessed 90 minutes after treatment, and quantitative angiography was performed in an angiographic core laboratory by investigators blinded to treatment assignment. The frequency of AET was reduced in patients who received abciximab combination therapy compared with thrombolytic monotherapy (26.6% versus 35.4%, P &lt;0.001). Similar findings were observed when the analysis was restricted to patients with patent arteries (14.7% versus 20.8%, P =0.001). Residual percent diameter stenosis at 90 minutes was also improved in the abciximab therapy group both in patent arteries (64.6±16.6 versus 68.3±14.8, P &lt;0.001) and between patent and occluded arteries (69.3±19.5 versus 73.8±17.9, P &lt;0.001). The absence of AET was associated with an increased frequency of &gt;70% ST-segment resolution by 90 minutes (37.2%, 110/296 versus 18.9%, 54/286, P &lt;0.001). Conclusions —Compared with thrombolytic monotherapy, combination therapy with abciximab reduces AET, which in turn is associated with reduced residual stenosis and improved ST-segment resolution in AMI. These data provide a pathophysiological link between platelet inhibition, reduced thrombus, and improvements in both epicardial and microvascular perfusion in AMI.",https://openalex.org/W2002429810,2001
Patent Ductus Arteriosus and Its Treatment as Risk Factors for Neonatal and Neurodevelopmental Morbidity,"OBJECTIVES. The purpose of this work was to determine whether the reported association between neonatal morbidities and a patent ductus arteriosus is because of the left-to-right patent ductus arteriosus shunt itself, the therapies used to treat it, or the immaturity of the infants who are likely to develop a patent ductus arteriosus. METHODS. A total of 446 infants (&amp;lt;28 weeks' gestation) were treated with the same patent ductus arteriosus care–oriented protocol, and logistic regression analysis was used to examine the effects of several patent ductus arteriosus–related variables (presence of a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus, the number of indomethacin doses used, the ductus response to indomethacin, and the use of surgical ligation) on the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, chronic lung disease, death, and neurodevelopmental impairment. RESULTS. Most of the predictive effects that the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus and its treatment had on neonatal morbidity could be accounted for by the infants' immature gestation. Use of surgical ligation, however, was significantly associated with the development of chronic lung disease and was independent of immature gestation, other patent ductus arteriosus–related variables, or other perinatal and neonatal risk factors known to be associated with chronic lung disease. CONCLUSIONS. These findings add to the growing uncertainty about the benefits and risks of surgical ligation during the neonatal period.",https://openalex.org/W2095199241,2007
Methods of Russian Patent Analysis,The article presents a method for extracting predicate-argument constructions characterizing the composition of the structural elements of the inventions and the relationships between them. The extracted structures are converted into a domain ontology and used in prior art patent search and information support of automated invention. The analysis of existing natural language processing (NLP) tools in relation to the processing of Russian-language patents has been carried out. A new method for extracting structured data from patents has been proposed taking into account the specificity of the text of patents and is based on the shallow parsing and segmentation of sentences. The value of the F1 metric for a rigorous estimate of data extraction is 63% and for a lax estimate is 79%. The results obtained suggest that the proposed method is promising.,https://openalex.org/W3009633590,2020

Emerging Technology Forecasting Using New Patent Information Analysis,"Emerging technology drives technological development and innovation in diverse fields of technology. Emerging technology forecasting can predict the possible areas of emerging technology. However, it is difficult to forecast the emerging technology because most technology forecasting tasks depend on the subjective experience of experts. Patent analysis is an objective method to recognize the trends in technological development. Many patent analysis methods have been researched; these methods apply text mining techniques to analyze the text data of patent documents such as the title and abstract. This approach has some limitations, namely the computing cost and information loss associated with the preprocessing step of text mining. Therefore, we propose a new patent information analysis to overcome these problems. Using the International Patent Classification codes from the patent documents of a target technology, we construct an emerging technology forecasting model. This research combines statistical inference and neural networks to construct our model for new patent information analysis. We perform a case study to verify how our research can be practically applied, using nanotechnology as the target technology. Therefore, we contribute this research to R&D planning.",https://openalex.org/W2187261910,2012

Trephor: A New Tool for Sampling Microcores from tree stems,"Detailed analyses of cambium activity and wood formation during growth need repeated sampling of newly formed xylem. In order to be minimally invasive, wood samples are extracted as microcores. Despite the research done on xylem cell development and the increasing interest in intra-annual studies of xylogenesis, few tools are available for microcore sampling. Methods originally designed for other purposes have often been used, but no details are available on their efficiency and usefulness. Information is also lacking on laboratory preparation techniques for cell analysis of tree-ring formation, leading to difficulties in carrying out these experiments. The advantages and limits of the tools used up to now are described. A new tool, named Trephor (patent pending n° PD2004A000324), specifically designed for long-lasting use is presented. Trephor is chisel-shaped for a fast recovery of 2 mm diameter microcores. The cutting tube is inserted into the wood using a hammer and no other accessory is required. Simple technical characteristics allow high quality samples to be collected from both softwood and hardwood species with minimum damage to the sampled trees. Trephor was tested during the 2004 growing season, demonstrating good resistance to wear and tear and mechanical stress. Embedding the microcores in paraffin for fast section preparation is described.",https://openalex.org/W2154154129,2006
Microvascular integrity indicates myocellular viability in patients with recent myocardial infarction. New insights using myocardial contrast echocardiography.,"BACKGROUND Patency of the infarct-related artery (IRA) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may not reflect the magnitude of tissue perfusion. In animal models of AMI, myocardial cellular necrosis has been associated with extensive capillary damage. Because myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) can define the spatial distribution of microvascular perfusion, we hypothesized that it could be used in patients after recent AMI to distinguish myocardial regions that have an intact microvasculature and thus are viable from those without an intact microvasculature and thus are not viable. METHODS AND RESULTS One hundred five patients with a recent AMI (range, 1 day to 4 weeks; median, 8 days) who were undergoing cardiac catheterization were included in the study. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed at baseline and repeated 1 month later to assess regional function within the infarct zone (scores of 1 to 5 indicating normal to dyskinetic segments, respectively). MCE was performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory to assess microvascular perfusion within the infarct bed. A contrast score index was derived by assigning scores to individual segments within the infarct zone (0, 0.5, and 1 denoting no, intermediate, and homogeneous contrast effect, respectively) and deriving the average score within the infarct bed. Revascularization was performed as clinically indicated. Although the baseline wall motion score and the contrast score index were similar in the 90 patients with a patent IRA and the 15 patients with an occluded IRA (median +/- 1 interquartile range, 3 +/- 1 versus 3.5 +/- 1; P = .41), wall motion score 1 month later was significantly better in those with open IRAs compared with those with closed IRAs (2 +/- 2 versus 3 +/- 2, P = .05). In the 90 patients with an open IRA, a strong correlation was noted between wall motion score 1 month later and the contrast score index (rho = -.64, P &lt; .001). On multivariate analysis, the best correlate of the 1-month wall motion score was the contrast score index. CONCLUSIONS In patients studied in the cardiac catheterization laboratory between 1 day and 4 weeks after AMI, an intact microvasculature as identified by MCE indicates myocardial regions that improve function 1 month later. This study demonstrates that microvascular patency is closely associated with myocardial cellular viability after AMI in humans.",https://openalex.org/W2064778528,1994
Patents for Genes and Methods of Analysis and Comparison,"In AMP v USPTO, a US District Court held that isolated human cancer genes are “products of nature”, and methods of analysis and comparison abstract mental processes, for which a US patent cannot validly be granted. Its decision undermined US patent granting practices, and widens the gap between US and European law on what constitutes inherently patentable subject matter (inventions), as well as proportionate patent grants. It did so at a time when the scope of protection for DNA sequences is the focus of European attention, along with inherent patentability itself, following the decisions in Monsanto (ECJ) and G_3/08 (EBA). Here I consider AMP from the perspective of European law, which has long supported patents for isolated genes, and methods of comparison and analysis, consistent with an expansive understanding of the invention. A central issue in this regard is how isolated genes are properly conceived as inventions. According to Sweet DJ in AMP, a DNA sequence is a physical embodiment of information, fundamentally different from other chemical products. However, while this may be a scientifically accurate conception, it is not necessarily appropriate for patent law. In my suggestion there is a more appropriate conception informed by a different understanding of the invention itself. Nonetheless, it is argued that Sweet DJ’s analysis is preferable to that of the EPO, and that the central significance of AMP for European law lies in the encouragement it offers to the EPO (in combination with Monsanto) to formulate a more meaningful definition of the invention than currently exists. A copy of this case note is available from my institutional website.",https://openalex.org/W1600213859,2010
Morphological Predictors of Arterial Remodeling in Coronary Atherosclerosis,"Background — Although arterial remodeling in atherosclerotic arteries affects luminal patency, the role of plaque components has not been systematically studied. Methods and Results — Coronary segments (n=2885) were harvested from the hearts of 36 patients who died of severe coronary artery disease after perfusion fixation. Remodeling was determined by morphometric analysis of 657 sections selected as reference segments and 1318 segments with atheromatous plaques. Atherosclerotic plaques were identified as fibroatheroma, thin-cap fibroatheroma, intraplaque hemorrhage with or without rupture or erosion, or total occlusion. Plaque components consisted of calcification, lipid core, macrophage burden, and fibrosis. There was no correlation between plaque area and lumen size in proximal arteries, unlike middle and distal segments, which demonstrated a significant correlation. Marked expansion of the internal elastic lamina (IEL) occurred in plaque hemorrhages with or without and thin-cap fibroatheroma (vulnerable plaque), whereas in erosions and total occlusions there was shrinkage of the IEL. Macrophage burden, lipid core size, calcium (in fibrous plaque and lipid core), and medial atrophy were all associated with positive remodeling; fibrous areas, however, were negatively associated with remodeling. Conclusions — Inflammation, calcification, and medial thinning are primary determinants of positive remodeling, which appears to be a feature of plaque instability.",https://openalex.org/W2047334981,2002
Patent analysis for analysing technological convergence,"Purpose Fusion of new technologies and convergence has led to the emergence of new industries. This paper aims to present experiences of the concept of convergence from a patent citation analysis viewpoint. The main objective of the paper is to develop a tool for anticipating the emerging new industry segments. Design/methodology/approach The patent analysis methods have been used to get an idea of the stage of new industry segment in the intersection of the paper and electronics industries. The authors distinguish self‐citations from external citations, and further divide citations into two groups: within the industry and beyond the industry. Backward citations are used to evaluate the spill‐overs between industries and forward citations are used to evaluate the significance of technology‐based industry transformation.
