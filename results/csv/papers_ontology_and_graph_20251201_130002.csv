Ontology Summarization: Graph-Based Methods and Beyond,"Ontologies have been widely used in numerous and varied applications, e.g. to support data modeling, information integration, and knowledge management. With the increasing size of ontologies, ontology understanding, which is playing an important role in different tasks, is becoming more difficult. Consequently, ontology summarization, as a way to distill key information from an ontology and generate an abridged version to facilitate a better understanding, is getting growing attention. In this survey paper we review existing ontology summarization techniques and focus mainly on graph-based methods, which represent an ontology as a graph and apply centrality-based and other measures to identify the most important elements of an ontology as its summary. After analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, we highlight a few potential directions for future research.",https://openalex.org/W2954203317,2019,Seyedamin Pouriyeh; Mehdi Allahyari; Qingxia Liu,Kennesaw State University; Georgia Southern University; Nanjing University
Ontology summarization based on rdf sentence graph,"Ontology summarization is very important to quick understanding and selection of ontologies. In this paper, we study extractive summarization of ontology. We propose a notion of RDF sentence as the basic unit of summarization. An RDF Sentence Graph is proposed to characterize the links between RDF sentences derived from a given ontology. The salience of each RDF sentence is assessed in terms of its ""centrality"" in the graph. We propose to summarize an ontology by extracting a set of salient RDF sentences according to a re-ranking strategy. We compare several measurements in assessing the salience of RDF sentences and give an overall evaluation of experiment results, which shows that our approach to ontology summarization is feasible.",https://openalex.org/W2105920890,2007,Xiang Zhang; Gong Cheng; Yuzhong Qu,
Developing an Ontology for Cyber Security Knowledge Graphs,"In this paper we describe an ontology developed for a cyber security knowledge graph database.

GMO: A Graph Matching for Ontologies.,"Ontology matching is an important task to achieve inter-operation between semantic web applications using dif-ferent ontologies. Structural similarity plays a central role in ontology matching. However, the existing ap-proaches rely heavily on lexical similarity, and they mix up lexical similarity with structural similarity. In this paper, we present a graph matching approach for on-tologies, called GMO. It uses bipartite graphs to repre-sent ontologies, and measures the structural similarity between graphs by a new measurement. Furthermore, GMO can take a set of matched pairs, which are typi-cally previously found by other approaches, as external input in matching process. Our implementation and experimental results are given to demonstrate the effec-tiveness of the graph matching approach.",https://openalex.org/W103919619,2005,Wei Hu; Ningsheng Jian; Yuzhong Qu,

Ontology- and graph-based similarity assessment in biological networks,"Abstract Summary: A standard systems-based approach to biomarker and drug target discovery consists of placing putative biomarkers in the context of a network of biological interactions, followed by different ‘guilt-by-association’ analyses. The latter is typically done based on network structural features. Here, an alternative analysis approach in which the networks are analyzed on a ‘semantic similarity’ space is reported. Such information is extracted from ontology-based functional annotations. We present SimTrek, a Cytoscape plugin for ontology-based similarity assessment in biological networks.

Integration Strategy and Tool between Formal Ontology and Graph Database Technology,"Ontologies, and especially formal ones, have traditionally been investigated as a means to formalize an application domain so as to carry out automated reasoning on it. The union of the terminological part of an ontology and the corresponding assertional part is known as a Knowledge Graph. On the other hand, database technology has often focused on the optimal organization of data so as to boost efficiency in their storage, management and retrieval. Graph databases are a recent technology specifically focusing on element-driven data browsing rather than on batch processing. While the complementarity and connections between these technologies are patent and intuitive, little exists to bring them to full integration and cooperation. This paper aims at bridging this gap, by proposing an intermediate format that can be easily mapped onto the formal ontology on one hand, so as to allow complex reasoning, and onto the graph database on the other, so as to benefit from efficient data handling.",https://openalex.org/W3208989277,2021,Stefano Ferilli,University of Bari Aldo Moro
REVIGO Summarizes and Visualizes Long Lists of Gene Ontology Terms,"Outcomes of high-throughput biological experiments are typically interpreted by statistical testing for enriched gene functional categories defined by the Gene Ontology (GO). The resulting lists of GO terms may be large and highly redundant, and thus difficult to interpret.REVIGO is a Web server that summarizes long, unintelligible lists of GO terms by finding a representative subset of the terms using a simple clustering algorithm that relies on semantic similarity measures. Furthermore, REVIGO visualizes this non-redundant GO term set in multiple ways to assist in interpretation: multidimensional scaling and graph-based visualizations accurately render the subdivisions and the semantic relationships in the data, while treemaps and tag clouds are also offered as alternative views.

UML Class Diagrams to OWL Ontologies: A Graph Transformation based Approach,"The models are placed by modeling paradigm at the center of development process.These models are represented by languages, like UML the language standardized by the OMG which became necessary for development.Moreover the ontology engineering paradigm places ontologies at the center of development process, in this paradigm we find OWL the explicitation language adopted by a great community of users like the principal language of knowledge representation.The bringing between UML and OWL appeared on several regards such as the classes and associations.In this paper, we propose an approach based graph transformation and registered in the MDA architecture for the automatic generation of usable OWL ontology from UML class diagrams.The transformation is based on transformation rules make it possible to achieve our aim.This approach is illustrated by an example.",https://openalex.org/W2003534440,2012,Aissam Belghiat; Mustapha Bourahla,Université de M'Sila
Extractive Text Summarization Using Ontology and Graph-Based Method,"In recent years, many people started to take care of the physical health. The biomedical article is the trendy issue at the moment leading to the huge amount of knowledge created rapidly. In this paper, we propose a new automatic extractive text summarization technique based on graph representation that makes use of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), an ontology knowledge from the National Library of Medicine (NLM). We combined the graph building rules with a distance function between text documents, called Word Mover's Distance. To prioritize the core sentences, we extracted the summary by using a popular graph-based method from Google, PageRank. We compared our results with other text summarization software using 400 biological review papers as a corpus randomly sampled from PubMed Central. Our approach outperformed the baseline comparators in terms of Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) scores.",https://openalex.org/W2971670955,2019,Chuleepohn Yongkiatpanich; Duangdao Wichadakul,Chulalongkorn University
Multiple testing on the directed acyclic graph of gene ontology,"Abstract Motivation: Current methods for multiplicity adjustment do not make use of the graph structure of Gene Ontology (GO) when testing for association of expression profiles of GO terms with a response variable. Results: We propose a multiple testing method, called the focus level procedure, that preserves the graph structure of Gene Ontology (GO). The procedure is constructed as a combination of a Closed Testing procedure with Holm's method. It requires a user to choose a ‘focus level’ in the GO graph, which reflects the level of specificity of terms in which the user is most interested. This choice also determines the level in the GO graph at which the procedure has most power. We prove that the procedure strongly controls the family-wise error rate without any additional assumptions on the joint distribution of the test statistics used. We also present an algorithm to calculate multiplicity-adjusted P-values. Because the focus level procedure preserves the structure of the GO graph, it does not generally preserve the ordering of the raw P-values in the adjusted P-values. Availability: The focus level procedure has been implemented in the globaltest and GlobalAncova packages, both of which are available on www.bioconductor.org.

Exploiting ontology graph for predicting sparsely annotated gene function,"Abstract Motivation: Systematically predicting gene (or protein) function based on molecular interaction networks has become an important tool in refining and enhancing the existing annotation catalogs, such as the Gene Ontology (GO) database. However, functional labels with only a few (&amp;lt;10) annotated genes, which constitute about half of the GO terms in yeast, mouse and human, pose a unique challenge in that any prediction algorithm that independently considers each label faces a paucity of information and thus is prone to capture non-generalizable patterns in the data, resulting in poor predictive performance. There exist a variety of algorithms for function prediction, but none properly address this ‘overfitting’ issue of sparsely annotated functions, or do so in a manner scalable to tens of thousands of functions in the human catalog. Results: We propose a novel function prediction algorithm, clusDCA, which transfers information between similar functional labels to alleviate the overfitting problem for sparsely annotated functions. Our method is scalable to datasets with a large number of annotations. In a cross-validation experiment in yeast, mouse and human, our method greatly outperformed previous state-of-the-art function prediction algorithms in predicting sparsely annotated functions, without sacrificing the performance on labels with sufficient information. Furthermore, we show that our method can accurately predict genes that will be assigned a functional label that has no known annotations, based only on the ontology graph structure and genes associated with other labels, which further suggests that our method effectively utilizes the similarity between gene functions.

Ontology-based Graph Visualization for Summarized View,"Data summarization that presents a small subset of a dataset to users has been widely applied in numerous applications and systems. Many datasets are coded with hierarchical terminologies, e.g., the international classification of Diseases-9, Medical Subject Heading, and Gene Ontology, to name a few. In this paper, we study the problem of selecting a diverse set of k elements to summarize an input dataset with hierarchical terminologies, and visualize the summary in an ontology structure. We propose an efficient greedy algorithm to solve the problem with (1-1/e)≈ 62%-approximation guarantee. Preliminary experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for data summarization.",https://openalex.org/W2767656473,2017,Xin Huang; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,Hong Kong Baptist University
High-throughput functional annotation and data mining with the Blast2GO suite,"Functional genomics technologies have been widely adopted in the biological research of both model and non-model species. An efficient functional annotation of DNA or protein sequences is a major requirement for the successful application of these approaches as functional information on gene products is often the key to the interpretation of experimental results. Therefore, there is an increasing need for bioinformatics resources which are able to cope with large amount of sequence data, produce valuable annotation results and are easily accessible to laboratories where functional genomics projects are being undertaken. We present the Blast2GO suite as an integrated and biologist-oriented solution for the high-throughput and automatic functional annotation of DNA or protein sequences based on the Gene Ontology vocabulary. The most outstanding Blast2GO features are: (i) the combination of various annotation strategies and tools controlling type and intensity of annotation, (ii) the numerous graphical features such as the interactive GO-graph visualization for gene-set function profiling or descriptive charts, (iii) the general sequence management features and (iv) high-throughput capabilities. We used the Blast2GO framework to carry out a detailed analysis of annotation behaviour through homology transfer and its impact in functional genomics research. Our aim is to offer biologists useful information to take into account when addressing the task of functionally characterizing their sequence data.",https://openalex.org/W1974116356,2008,Stefan Götz; Juan M.

Ontology-Based Graphs of Research Communities: A Tool for Understanding Threat Reduction Networks,"Scientific research communities can be represented as heterogeneous or multidimensional networks encompassing multiple types of entities and relationships. These networks might include researchers, institutions, meetings, and publications, connected by relationships like authorship, employment, and attendance. We describe a method for efficiently and flexibly capturing, storing, and extracting information from multidimensional scientific networks using a graph database. The database structure is based on an ontology that captures allowable types of entities and relationships. This allows us to construct a variety of projections of the underlying multidimensional graph through database queries to answer specific research questions. We demonstrate this process through a study of the U.S. Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP), which seeks to develop Threat Reduction Networks to build and strengthen a sustainable international community of biosecurity, biosafety, and biosurveillance experts to address shared biological threat reduction challenges. Networks like these create connectional intelligence among researchers and institutions around the world, and are central to the concept of cooperative threat reduction. Our analysis focuses on a series of seven BTRP genome sequencing training workshops, showing how they created a growing network of participants and countries over time, which is also reflected in coauthorship relationships among attendees. By capturing concept and relationship hierarchies, our ontology-based approach allows us to pose general or specific questions about networks within the same framework. This approach can be applied to other research communities or multidimensional social networks to capture, analyze, and visualize different types of interactions and how they change over time.",https://openalex.org/W3034592942,2020,John Ambrosiano; Benjamin Sims; Andrew W.

An ontology-based graph approach to support buildings design conformity with a given style,"This paper deals with analysing and evaluating design suitability for a given environment. A design is deemed to “fit” into the environment in which it is planned to be built if it follows the same style and shows sufficient “closeness” to other buildings in the area. The knowledge about the designed building is encoded in the form of a labelled graph. To test the conformity of the design with a given style an ontology-based graph approach is proposed, while to calculate the degree of similarity of the design to other designs graph mining methods are used. The proposed approach is illustrated by examples of designing buildings in two styles which are well integrated with the environment.",https://openalex.org/W2555626901,2016,Grażyna Ślusarczyk; Barbara Strug; Karolina Stasiak,Jagiellonian University
Manifestation of ontologies in graph databases for big data risk analysis,"Big Data Risk Analysis (BDRA) intends to combine the huge volume of information that railway systems produce from a variety of data sources for safety and risk management. One of the most challenging issues is how safety scientists can use big data techniques. This is especially important in the light of data coming from different systems that hold information about critical events, hazards or controls. Yet, the integration of com-plex safety-related data is not just another IT problem. Fundamentally, it requires the expertise of safety ex-perts in order to make sense of the data. A solution lies in the use of graph databases and ontologies to access this data for safety purposes. This type of database allows for the handling of huge amounts of data whilst it is still accessible to safety experts that are not gifted programmers. This approach opens up big data for safety management and enables a plethora of possibilities for future safety research.",https://openalex.org/W2883749243,2018,Miguel Figueres-Esteban; Peter Hughes; R.A.H.

Different from other commercial software for creating chart, WEGO is designed to deal with the directed acyclic graph structure of GO to facilitate histogram creation of GO annotation results. WEGO has been used widely in many important biological research projects, such as the rice genome project and the silkworm genome project. It has become one of the daily tools for downstream gene annotation analysis, especially when performing comparative genomics tasks.

OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Mapping to RDF Graphs,"The OWL 2 Web Ontology Language, informally OWL 2, is an ontology language for the Semantic Web with formally defined meaning.

OWL 2 ontologies can be used along with information written in RDF, and OWL 2 ontologies themselves are primarily exchanged as RDF documents.

Ontology-based entity matching in attributed graphs,"Keys for graphs incorporate the topology and value constraints needed to uniquely identify entities in a graph. They have been studied to support object identification, knowledge fusion, and social network reconciliation. Existing key constraints identify entities as the matches of a graph pattern by subgraph isomorphism, which enforce label equality on node types. These constraints can be too restrictive to characterize structures and node labels that are syntactically different but semantically equivalent. We propose a new class of key constraints, Ontological Graph Keys (OGKs) that extend conventional graph keys by ontological subgraph matching between entity labels and an external ontology. We show that the implication and validation problems for OGKs are each NP-complete. To reduce the entity matching cost, we also provide an algorithm to compute a minimal cover for OGKs. We then study the entity matching problem with OGKs, and a practical variant with a budget on the matching cost. We develop efficient algorithms to perform entity matching based on a (budgeted) Chase procedure. Using real-world graphs, we experimentally verify the efficiency and accuracy of OGK-based entity matching.",https://openalex.org/W2966581343,2019,Hanchao Ma; Morteza Alipourlangouri; Yinghui Wu,Washington State University; McMaster University
Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs in Oncology Research,"The complexity of cancer research stems from leaning on several biomedical disciplines for relevant sources of data, many of which are complex in their own right. A holistic view of cancer—which is critical for precision medicine approaches—hinges on integrating a variety of heterogeneous data sources under a cohesive knowledge model, a role which biomedical ontologies can fill. This study reviews the application of ontologies and knowledge graphs in cancer research. In total, our review encompasses 141 published works, which we categorized under 14 hierarchical categories according to their usage of ontologies and knowledge graphs. We also review the most commonly used ontologies and newly developed ones. Our review highlights the growing traction of ontologies in biomedical research in general, and cancer research in particular. Ontologies enable data accessibility, interoperability and integration, support data analysis, facilitate data interpretation and data mining, and more recently, with the emergence of the knowledge graph paradigm, support the application of Artificial Intelligence methods to unlock new knowledge from a holistic view of the available large volumes of heterogeneous data.",https://openalex.org/W4223568044,2022,Marta Contreiras Silva; Patrícia Eugénio; Daniel Faria,University of Lisbon
Automatically inferring technology compatibility with an ontology and graph rewriting rules,"&lt;p&gt;In conceptual design of any engineering system, decisions are made regarding which technologies to include and where. One of the first stages of that process is constructing the technology compatibility matrix (TCM), which indicates the compatibility of each pair in a technology set. Rather than constructing a TCM with expert judgment, this study develops a method based on graph transformation rules, allowing for a formal description of technologies. The TCM is then automatically derived. An ontology based on the Basic Formal Ontology is developed to describe systems and technologies, and provides axioms to derive statements about these descriptions. The method is demonstrated with four inference examples, showing how the inferences are made. An industry case study demonstrates the method's ability to mimic human expert reasoning. Although the approach is labour-intensive during setup, it enables knowledge capturing, automated reasoning and can be extended to provide quantitative analysis, to save time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;",https://openalex.org/W3115826067,2020,Martijn N.

Text2KGBench: A Benchmark for Ontology-Driven Knowledge Graph Generation from Text,"The recent advances in large language models (LLM) and foundation models with emergent capabilities have been shown to improve the performance of many NLP tasks. LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KG) can complement each other such that LLMs can be used for KG construction or completion while existing KGs can be used for different tasks such as making LLM outputs explainable or fact-checking in Neuro-Symbolic manner. In this paper, we present Text2KGBench, a benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of language models to generate KGs from natural language text guided by an ontology. Given an input ontology and a set of sentences, the task is to extract facts from the text while complying with the given ontology (concepts, relations, domain/range constraints) and being faithful to the input sentences. We provide two datasets (i) Wikidata-TekGen with 10 ontologies and 13,474 sentences and (ii) DBpedia-WebNLG with 19 ontologies and 4,860 sentences. We define seven evaluation metrics to measure fact extraction performance, ontology conformance, and hallucinations by LLMs. Furthermore, we provide results for two baseline models, Vicuna-13B and Alpaca-LoRA-13B using automatic prompt generation from test cases. The baseline results show that there is room for improvement using both Semantic Web and Natural Language Processing techniques.

A New Method for Knowledge and Information Management Domain Ontology Graph Model,"A new ontology learning model called domain ontology graph (DOG) is proposed in this paper. There are two key components in the DOG, i.e., the definition of the ontology graph and the ontology learning process. The former defines the ontology and knowledge conceptualization model from the domain-specific text documents; the latter offers the necessary method of semiautomatic domain ontology learning and generates the corresponding ontology graphs. Two kinds of ontological operations are also defined based on the proposed DOG, i.e., document ontology graph generation and ontology-graph-based text classification. The simulation studies focused upon Chinese text data are used to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of our proposed strategy. This is accomplished by generating DOGs to represent the domain knowledge and conducting the text classifications based on the generated ontology graph. The experimental results show that the new method can produce significantly better classification accuracy (e.g., with 92.3% in f-measure) compared with other methods (such as 86.8% in f-measure for the term-frequency-inverse-document- frequency approach). The high performance demonstrates that our presented ontological operations based on the ontology graph knowledge model are effectively developed.",https://openalex.org/W1981265597,2012,James N. K.

Clustering Ontology-enriched Graph Representation for Biomedical Documents based on Scale-Free Network Theory,"In this paper we introduce a novel document clustering approach that solves some major problems of traditional document clustering approaches. Instead of depending on traditional vector space model, this approach represents documents as graphs using domain knowledge in ontology because graphs can represent the semantic relationships among the concepts in documents. Based on scale-free network theory, our approach generates a model for each document cluster from the ontology-enriched graph representation by identifying k high density subgraphs capturing the core semantic relationship information about each document cluster. Using these k high density subgraphs, each document is assigned to a proper document cluster. Our extensive experimental results on MEDLINE articles show that our approach outperforms two leading document clustering algorithms, BiSecting K-means and CLUTO's vcluster. Moreover, our approach provides a meaningful explanation for document clustering through generated models. This explanation helps users to understand clustering results and documents as a whole",https://openalex.org/W2536154007,2006,Illhoi Yoo; Xiaohua Hu,Drexel University
Improved scoring of functional groups from gene expression data by decorrelating GO graph structure,"Abstract Motivation: The result of a typical microarray experiment is a long list of genes with corresponding expression measurements. This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance. Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.

Neo4j graph database realizes efficient storage performance of oilfield ontology,"The integration of oilfield multidisciplinary ontology is increasingly important for the growth of the Semantic Web. However, current methods encounter performance bottlenecks either in storing data and searching for information when processing large amounts of data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a domain-ontology process based on the Neo4j graph database. In this paper, we focus on data storage and information retrieval of oilfield ontology. We have designed mapping rules from ontology files to regulate the Neo4j database, which can greatly reduce the required storage space. A two-tier index architecture, including object and triad indexing, is used to keep loading times low and match with different patterns for accurate retrieval.

Based on our evaluation, the retrieval method can save 13.04% of the storage space and improve retrieval efficiency by more than 30 times compared with the methods of relational databases.",https://openalex.org/W2901176735,2018,Faming Gong; Yuhui Ma; Wenjuan Gong,"China University of Petroleum, East China"
A novel ontology relation graph-based ontology module partition algorithm,"In order to help Agent or semantic annotation tool in real-time understanding of the text, this paper presents an ontology module partition method: partitioning large broad-coverage ontologism into small ontology modules and storing the partition in advance, in the stage of real-time, according to the application requirements, selecting the appropriate modular from the ontology modular library, then applying directly or composing the selected modules. This time-consuming procedure of ontology extraction and decomposition is put into pre-processing process, which can improve real-time process and improve the efficiency. In this paper, ontology module partition criteria and methods are discussed. The method discussed in this article can partition corresponding ontology in different level of granularities. The ontology relation graph-based ontology module partition algorithm employed extended adjacency list as the storage structure in which the asymptotic time complexity of extended broad first traverse of ontology relation graph is O(n+e).",https://openalex.org/W2148536774,2012,Xiaohui Ji; Jie Xie,Luoyang Institute of Science and Technology
Delta: an ontology for the distribution of differences between RDF graphs,"The problem of updating and synchronizing data in the Semantic Web motivates an analog to text diffs for RDF graphs. This paper discusses the problem of comparing two RDF graphs, generating a set of differences, and updating a graph from a set of differences. It discusses two forms of difference information, the context-sensitive “weak” patch, and the context-free “strong” patch. It gives a proposed update ontology for patch files for RDF, and discusses experience with proof of concept code.",https://openalex.org/W67952721,2015,Tim Berners‐Lee; Dan Connolly,
"A curated, ontology-based, large-scale knowledge graph of artificial intelligence tasks and benchmarks","Abstract Research in artificial intelligence (AI) is addressing a growing number of tasks through a rapidly growing number of models and methodologies. This makes it difficult to keep track of where novel AI methods are successfully – or still unsuccessfully – applied, how progress is measured, how different advances might synergize with each other, and how future research should be prioritized. To help address these issues, we created the Intelligence Task Ontology and Knowledge Graph (ITO), a comprehensive, richly structured and manually curated resource on artificial intelligence tasks, benchmark results and performance metrics. The current version of ITO contains 685,560 edges, 1,100 classes representing AI processes and 1,995 properties representing performance metrics. The primary goal of ITO is to enable analyses of the global landscape of AI tasks and capabilities. ITO is based on technologies that allow for easy integration and enrichment with external data, automated inference and continuous, collaborative expert curation of underlying ontological models. We make the ITO dataset and a collection of Jupyter notebooks utilizing ITO openly available.",https://openalex.org/W3203709253,2022,Kathrin Blagec; Adriano Barbosa-Silva; Simon Ott,Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence; Medical University of Vienna
Construction and application of an ontology-based domain-specific knowledge graph for petroleum exploration and development,"The massive amount and multi-sourced, multi-structured data in the upstream petroleum industry impose great challenge on data integration and smart application. Knowledge graph, as an emerging technology, can potentially provide a way to tackle the challenges associated with oil and gas big data. This paper proposes an engineering-based method that can improve upon traditional natural language processing to construct the domain knowledge graph based on a petroleum exploration and development ontology. The exploration and development knowledge graph is constructed by assembling Sinopec's multi-sourced heterogeneous database, and millions of nodes. The two applications based on the constructed knowledge graph are developed and validated for effectiveness and advantages in providing better knowledge services for the oil and gas industry.",https://openalex.org/W4293072913,2022,Xianming Tang; Zhiqiang Feng; Yitian Xiao,Sinopec (China)
Logic on MARS: Ontologies for Generalised Property Graphs,"Graph-structured data is used to represent large information collections, called knowledge graphs, in many applications. Their exact format may vary, but they often share the concept that edges can be annotated with additional information, such as validity time or provenance information. Property Graph is a popular graph database format that also provides this feature. We give a formalisation of a generalised notion of Property Graphs, called multi-attributed relational structures (MARS), and introduce a matching knowledge representation formalism, multi-attributed predicate logic (MAPL). We analyse the expressive power of MAPL and suggest a simpler, rule-based fragment of MAPL that can be used for ontological reasoning on Property Graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to making Property Graphs and related data structures accessible to symbolic AI.",https://openalex.org/W2739618783,2017,Maximilian Marx; Markus Krötzsch; Veronika Thost,Technische Universität Dresden; Center for Advancing Health

A Platform-Independent Approach for Parallel Reasoning with OWL EL Ontologies Using Graph Representation,"OWL EL is a tractable fragment of OWL 2. Classification, which is the task of computing a subsumption hierarchy between concepts, plays an important role in many applications of OWL EL. The current classification methods are proposed based on the specific parallel computation platforms, thus can hardly adapt to other platforms and satisfy different needs of users or developers. In this paper, we propose a platform-independent approach to perform classification in OWL EL. We first give a novel and well defined graph formalism GEL for representing EL ontologies. Based on this formalism, we describe the classification using a platform-independent computation model, and discuss the lower bound of run-time. We further give a refined algorithm based on the proposed model, and show the correctness of the algorithm. We implement a prototype system, which can easily switch between multi-core and a distributed cluster. Finally, we conduct experiments on several real world ontologies. The experimental results show that our system outperforms two state-of-theart EL reasoning systems, and has a linear scalability on the extensions of GO ontologies.",https://openalex.org/W2240363145,2015,Zhangquan Zhou; Guilin Qi; Zimian Wu,Southeast University
A graph-based approach for ontology population with named entities,"Automatically populating ontology with named entities extracted from the unstructured text has become a key issue for Semantic Web and knowledge management techniques. This issue naturally consists of two subtasks: (1) for the entity mention whose mapping entity does not exist in the ontology, attach it to the right category in the ontology (i.e., fine-grained named entity classification), and (2) for the entity mention whose mapping entity is contained in the ontology, link it with its mapping real world entity in the ontology (i.e., entity linking). Previous studies only focus on one of the two subtasks and cannot solve this task of populating ontology with named entities integrally. This paper proposes APOLLO, a grAph-based aPproach for pOpuLating ontoLOgy with named entities. APOLLO leverages the rich semantic knowledge embedded in the Wikipedia to resolve this task via random walks on graphs. Meanwhile, APOLLO can be directly applied to either of the two subtasks with minimal revision. We have conducted a thorough experimental study to evaluate the performance of APOLLO. The experimental results show that APOLLO achieves significant accuracy improvement for the task of ontology population with named entities, and outperforms the baseline methods for both subtasks.",https://openalex.org/W2135127625,2012,Wei Shen; Jianyong Wang; Ping Luo,Tsinghua University
Synergizing ontologies and graph databases for highly flexible materials-to-device workflow representations,"The escalating adoption of high-throughput methods in applied materials science dramatically increases the amount of generated data, demandingthe deployment and use of sophisticated data-driven methods. To exploit the full potential of these accelerated approaches, the generated data needs to be managed, preserved, and shared. Its heterogeneity calls for highly flexible data models to represent data from fabrication workflows, measurements, and simulations. We propose employing a native graph database to store the data instead of relying on rigid relational data models. To develop a flexible and extendable data model, we have created an EMMO-based ontology, where EMMO stands for European Materials Modelling Ontology. The Python framework Django is used to allow for the intuitive integration into the virtual materials intelligence platform, VIMI. The Django framework relies on the Object-Graph-Mapper (OGM) neomodel to create a mapping between database classes and python objects. The model can store the whole bandwidth of data, from fabrication to simulation data. Implementing the database into a platform will encourage researchers to share data while profiting from rich and highly curated data to accelerate their research.",https://openalex.org/W4318814320,2023,Max Dreger; Kourosh Malek; Mohammed J.

Intelligent Text Mining for Ontological Knowledge Graph Refinement and Patent Portfolio Analysis—Case Study of Net-Zero Data Center Innovation Management,"Ontological knowledge graph (OKG) is a well-formed visual representation that depicts knowledge organization in formal elements (e.g., entities and attributes) and their interrelationships. OKG is crucial for innovation management analysis as it provides a clear boundary to understand complex knowledge domain in detail. In the patent analysis field, it facilitates the definition of a well-defined patent portfolio, aiming for accurate and complete patent retrievals and subsequent analyses. In recent decade, the rapid growth of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector has rendered data centers (DCs) indispensable for data processing, storage, and cloud computing, while ensuring security and privacy during DC operations. However, their energy-intensive operations pose challenges to global efforts toward achieving net-zero emissions goals. In response, this research develops a formal OKG refinement process and uses DC net-zero technology OKG as case study for in-depth OKG refinement and application in patent portfolio analysis. The net-zero DC domain covers five sub-technologies. Utilizing the proposed OKG refinement and patent portfolio analysis framework, the 1801 most recent decade’s patents related to relevant “DC net-zero technologies” are retrieved and analyzed. Particularly in this case, DC colocation and server-as-a-service perspectives are the newly discovered sub-domains for OKG refinement.

MEDTO: Medical Data to Ontology Matching Using Hybrid Graph Neural Networks,"Medical ontologies are widely used to describe and organize medical terminologies and to support many critical applications on healthcare databases. These ontologies are often manually curated (e.g., UMLS, SNOMED CT, and MeSH) by medical experts. Medical databases, on the other hand, are often created by database administrators, using different terminology and structures. The discrepancies between medical ontologies and databases compromise interoperability between them. Data to ontology matching is the process of finding semantic correspondences between tables in databases to standard ontologies. Existing solutions such as ontology matching have mostly focused on engineering features from terminological, structural, and semantic model information extracted from the ontologies. However, this is often labor intensive and the accuracy varies greatly across different ontologies. Worse yet, the ontology capturing a medical database is often not given in practice. In this paper, we propose MEDTO, a novel end-to-end framework that consists of three innovative techniques: (1) a lightweight yet effective method that bootstrap a semantically rich ontology from a given medical database, (2) a hyperbolic graph convolution layer that encodes hierarchical concepts in the hyperbolic space, and (3) a heterogeneous graph layer that encodes both local and global context information of a concept. Experiments on two real-world medical datasets matching against SNOMED CT show significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art methods. MEDTO also consistently achieves competitive results on a benchmark from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative.",https://openalex.org/W3171177851,2021,Junheng Hao; Chuan Lei; Vasilis Efthymiou,"University of California, Los Angeles; IBM Research - Almaden; FORTH Institute of Computer Science"
Generative Retrieval-Augmented Ontologic Graph and Multiagent Strategies for Interpretive Large Language Model-Based Materials Design,"Transformer neural networks show promising capabilities, in particular for uses in materials analysis, design, and manufacturing, including their capacity to work effectively with human language, symbols, code, and numerical data. Here, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as a tool that can support engineering analysis of materials, applied to retrieving key information about subject areas, developing research hypotheses, discovery of mechanistic relationships across disparate areas of knowledge, and writing and executing simulation codes for active knowledge generation based on physical ground truths. Moreover, when used as sets of AI agents with specific features, capabilities, and instructions, LLMs can provide powerful problem-solution strategies for applications in analysis and design problems. Our experiments focus on using a fine-tuned model, MechGPT, developed based on training data in the mechanics of materials domain. We first affirm how fine-tuning endows LLMs with a reasonable understanding of subject area knowledge. However, when queried outside the context of learned matter, LLMs can have difficulty recalling correct information and may hallucinate. We show how this can be addressed using retrieval-augmented Ontological Knowledge Graph strategies. The graph-based strategy helps us not only to discern how the model understands what concepts are important but also how they are related, which significantly improves generative performance and also naturally allows for injection of new and augmented data sources into generative AI algorithms. We find that the additional feature of relatedness provides advantages over regular retrieval augmentation approaches and not only improves LLM performance but also provides mechanistic insights for exploration of a material design process. Illustrated for a use case of relating distinct areas of knowledge, here, music and proteins, such strategies can also provide an interpretable graph structure with rich information at the node, edge, and subgraph level that provides specific insights into mechanisms and relationships. We discuss other approaches to improve generative qualities, including nonlinear sampling strategies and agent-based modeling that offer enhancements over single-shot generations, whereby LLMs are used to both generate content and assess content against an objective target. Examples provided include complex question answering, code generation, and execution in the context of automated force-field development from actively learned density functional theory (DFT) modeling and data analysis.",https://openalex.org/W4390824394,2024,Markus J.

Ontology-aware partitioning for knowledge graph identification,"Knowledge graphs provide a powerful representation of entities and the relationships between them, but automatically constructing such graphs from noisy extractions presents numerous challenges. Knowledge graph identification (KGI) is a technique for knowledge graph construction that jointly reasons about entities, attributes and relations in the presence of uncertain inputs and ontological constraints. Although knowledge graph identification shows promise scaling to knowledge graphs built from millions of extractions, increasingly powerful extraction engines may soon require knowledge graphs built from billions of extractions. One tool for scaling is partitioning extractions to allow reasoning to occur in parallel. We explore approaches which leverage ontological information and distributional information in partitioning. We compare these techniques with hash-based approaches, and show that using a richer partitioning model that incorporates the ontology graph and distribution of extractions provides superior results. Our results demonstrate that partitioning can result in order-of-magnitude speedups without reducing model performance.",https://openalex.org/W2065239743,2013,Jay Pujara; Hui Miao; Lise Getoor,"University of Maryland, College Park"

Perturbation Ontology based Graph Attention Networks,"In recent years, graph representation learning has undergone a paradigm shift, driven by the emergence and proliferation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their heterogeneous counterparts. Heterogeneous GNNs have shown remarkable success in extracting low-dimensional embeddings from complex graphs that encompass diverse entity types and relationships. While meta-path-based techniques have long been recognized for their ability to capture semantic affinities among nodes, their dependence on manual specification poses a significant limitation. In contrast, matrix-focused methods accelerate processing by utilizing structural cues but often overlook contextual richness. In this paper, we challenge the current paradigm by introducing ontology as a fundamental semantic primitive within complex graphs. Our goal is to integrate the strengths of both matrix-centric and meta-path-based approaches into a unified framework. We propose perturbation Ontology-based Graph Attention Networks (POGAT), a novel methodology that combines ontology subgraphs with an advanced self-supervised learning paradigm to achieve a deep contextual understanding. The core innovation of POGAT lies in our enhanced homogeneous perturbing scheme designed to generate rigorous negative samples, encouraging the model to explore minimal contextual features more thoroughly. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that POGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a groundbreaking improvement of up to 10.78\% in F1-score for the critical task of link prediction and 12.01\% in Micro-F1 for the critical task of node classification.",https://openalex.org/W4404993655,2024,Yichen Wang; Jie Wang; F.

Protein classification using probabilistic chain graphs and the Gene Ontology structure,"Abstract Motivation: Probabilistic graphical models have been developed in the past for the task of protein classification. In many cases, classifications obtained from the Gene Ontology have been used to validate these models. In this work we directly incorporate the structure of the Gene Ontology into the graphical representation for protein classification. We present a method in which each protein is represented by a replicate of the Gene Ontology structure, effectively modeling each protein in its own ‘annotation space’. Proteins are also connected to one another according to different measures of functional similarity, after which belief propagation is run to make predictions at all ontology terms. Results: The proposed method was evaluated on a set of 4879 proteins from the Saccharomyces Genome Database whose interactions were also recorded in the GRID project. Results indicate that direct utilization of the Gene Ontology improves predictive ability, outperforming traditional models that do not take advantage of dependencies among functional terms. Average increase in accuracy (precision) of positive and negative term predictions of 27.8% (2.0%) over three different similarity measures and three subontologies was observed.

From human experts to machines: An LLM supported approach to ontology and knowledge graph construction,"The conventional process of building Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) heavily relies on human domain experts to define entities and relationship types, establish hierarchies, maintain relevance to the domain, fill the ABox (or populate with instances), and ensure data quality (including amongst others accuracy and completeness). On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained popularity for their ability to understand and generate human-like natural language, offering promising ways to automate aspects of this process. This work explores the (semi-)automatic construction of KGs facilitated by open-source LLMs. Our pipeline involves formulating competency questions (CQs), developing an ontology (TBox) based on these CQs, constructing KGs using the developed ontology, and evaluating the resultant KG with minimal to no involvement of human experts. We showcase the feasibility of our semi-automated pipeline by creating a KG on deep learning methodologies by exploiting scholarly publications. To evaluate the answers generated via Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) as well as the KG concepts automatically extracted using LLMs, we design a judge LLM, which rates the generated content based on ground truth. Our findings suggest that employing LLMs could potentially reduce the human effort involved in the construction of KGs, although a human-in-the-loop approach is recommended to evaluate automatically generated KGs.",https://openalex.org/W4392822529,2024,Vamsi Krishna Kommineni; Birgitta König‐Ries; Sheeba Samuel,

Assessing the functional coherence of gene sets with metrics based on the Gene Ontology graph,"Abstract Motivation: The results of initial analyses for many high-throughput technologies commonly take the form of gene or protein sets, and one of the ensuing tasks is to evaluate the functional coherence of these sets. The study of gene set function most commonly makes use of controlled vocabulary in the form of ontology annotations. For a given gene set, the statistical significance of observing these annotations or ‘enrichment’ may be tested using a number of methods. Instead of testing for significance of individual terms, this study is concerned with the task of assessing the global functional coherence of gene sets, for which novel metrics and statistical methods have been devised. Results: The metrics of this study are based on the topological properties of graphs comprised of genes and their Gene Ontology annotations. A novel aspect of these methods is that both the enrichment of annotations and the relationships among annotations are considered when determining the significance of functional coherence. We applied our methods to perform analyses on an existing database and on microarray experimental results. Here, we demonstrated that our approach is highly discriminative in terms of differentiating coherent gene sets from random ones and that it provides biologically sensible evaluations in microarray analysis. We further used examples to show the utility of graph visualization as a tool for studying the functional coherence of gene sets.

Semantic Zooming for Ontology Graph Visualizations,"Visualizations of ontologies, in particular graph visualizations in the form of node-link diagrams, are often used to support ontology development, exploration, verification, and sensemaking. With growing size and complexity of ontology graph visualizations, their represented information tend to become hard to comprehend due to visual clutter and information overload. We present a new approach of semantic zooming for ontology graph visualizations that abstracts and simplifies the underlying graph structure. It separates the comprised information into three layers with discrete levels of detail. The approach is applied to a force-directed graph layout using the VOWL notation. The mental map is preserved by using smart expanding and ordering of elements in the layout. Navigation and sensemaking are supported by local and global exploration methods, halo visualization, and smooth zooming. The results of a user study confirm an increase in readability, visual clarity, and information clarity of ontology graph visualizations enhanced with our semantic zooming approach.",https://openalex.org/W2776224860,2017,Vitalis Wiens; Steffen Lohmann; Sören Auer,University of Bonn; Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems; Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB)

A Graph Derivation Based Approach for Measuring and Comparing Structural Semantics of Ontologies,"Ontology reuse offers great benefits by measuring and comparing ontologies. However, the state of art approaches for measuring ontologies neglects the problems of both the polymorphism of ontology representation and the addition of implicit semantic knowledge. One way to tackle these problems is to devise a mechanism for ontology measurement that is stable, the basic criteria for automatic measurement. In this paper, we present a graph derivation representation based approach (GDR) for stable semantic measurement, which captures structural semantics of ontologies and addresses those problems that cause unstable measurement of ontologies. This paper makes three original contributions. First, we introduce and define the concept of semantic measurement and the concept of stable measurement. We present the GDR based approach, a three-phase process to transform an ontology to its GDR. Second, we formally analyze important properties of GDRs based on which stable semantic measurement and comparison can be achieved successfully. Third but not the least, we compare our GDR based approach with existing graph based methods using a dozen real world exemplar ontologies. Our experimental comparison is conducted based on nine ontology measurement entities and distance metric, which stably compares the similarity of two ontologies in terms of their GDRs.",https://openalex.org/W1992366072,2013,Yinglong Ma; Ling Liu; Ke Lü,North China Electric Power University; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences

Towards a parametric ontology modularization framework based on graph transformation,"Several tools and techniques have been proposed recently for extracting modules from ontologies. Being focused on some particular application scenario, modularization tools generally rely on their own definitions and intuitions about modularity. In this paper, it is proposed that these different techniques be expressed under a common framework.&#13;\nAs most of the existing approaches rely on the traversal of the graph underlying the ontology to harvest relevant entities and axioms, the framework chosen is based on graph transformation. An abstract model for representing ontologies as attributed graphs is described, along with the reformulation of existing module extraction techniques as graph transformation rules.

A Graph-BasedWeb Service Composition Technique Using Ontological Information,"We investigate Web service composition as a planning problem and use the input-output parameter relations in order to select the constituent services that make up the composite service. Furthermore, we make use of ontological information between the input-output parameters such that a more specific concept can be used instead of a general concept to make the process more flexible. Our proposed approach is based on constructing a dependency graph including the service parameters and Web services themselves. By using this dependency graph, we perform backward chaining starting to search from the desired output parameters, which is in fact the goal, to the available input parameters. In addition to using semantic information through the search, our approach considers non-functional attributes of the services such as service quality. Considering the quality measures, we find the constituent services by making use of depth first search.

Graph embeddings on gene ontology annotations for protein–protein interaction prediction,"Abstract Background Protein–protein interaction (PPI) prediction is an important task towards the understanding of many bioinformatics functions and applications, such as predicting protein functions, gene-disease associations and disease-drug associations. However, many previous PPI prediction researches do not consider missing and spurious interactions inherent in PPI networks. To address these two issues, we define two corresponding tasks, namely missing PPI prediction and spurious PPI prediction, and propose a method that employs graph embeddings that learn vector representations from constructed Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) graphs and then use embedded vectors to achieve the two tasks. Our method leverages on information from both term–term relations among GO terms and term-protein annotations between GO terms and proteins, and preserves properties of both local and global structural information of the GO annotation graph. Results We compare our method with those methods that are based on information content (IC) and one method that is based on word embeddings, with experiments on three PPI datasets from STRING database. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more effective than those compared methods. Conclusion Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using graph embeddings to learn vector representations from undirected GOA graphs for our defined missing and spurious PPI tasks.",https://openalex.org/W3112306601,2020,Xiaoshi Zhong; Jagath C.

Ontology-based Graph Visualization for Summarized View,"Data summarization that presents a small subset of a dataset to users has been widely applied in numerous applications and systems. Many datasets are coded with hierarchical terminologies, e.g., the international classification of Diseases-9, Medical Subject Heading, and Gene Ontology, to name a few. In this paper, we study the problem of selecting a diverse set of k elements to summarize an input dataset with hierarchical terminologies, and visualize the summary in an ontology structure. We propose an efficient greedy algorithm to solve the problem with (1-1/e) = 62% -approximation guarantee. Although this greedy solution achieves quality-guaranteed answers approximately but it is still not optimal. To tackle the problem optimally, we further develop a dynamic programming algorithm to obtain optimal answers for graph visualization of log-data using ontology terminologies called OVDO . The complexity and correctness of OVDO are theoretically analyzed. In addition, we propose a useful optimization technique of tree reduction to remove useless nodes with zero weights and shrink the tree into a smaller one, which ensures the efficiency acceleration of OVDO in many real-world applications. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approximate and exact algorithms for tree data summarization.",https://openalex.org/W3048343889,2020,Xu-Liang Zhu; Xin Huang; Byron Choi,
"An Accurate and Efficient Approach to Knowledge Extraction from Scientific Publications Using Structured Ontology Models, Graph Neural Networks, and Large Language Models","The rapid growth of biomedical literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current. Integrating knowledge from various sources is crucial for studying complex biological systems. Traditional text-mining methods often have limited accuracy because they don’t capture semantic and contextual nuances. Deep-learning models can be computationally expensive and typically have low interpretability, though efforts in explainable AI aim to mitigate this. Furthermore, transformer-based models have a tendency to produce false or made-up information—a problem known as hallucination—which is especially prevalent in large language models (LLMs). This study proposes a hybrid approach combining text-mining techniques with graph neural networks (GNNs) and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to extend biomedical knowledge graphs and interpret predicted edges based on published literature. An LLM is used to validate predictions and provide explanations. Evaluated on a corpus of experimentally confirmed protein interactions, the approach achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.772. Applied to insomnia, the approach identified 25 interactions between 32 human proteins absent in known knowledge bases, including regulatory interactions between MAOA and 5-HT2C, binding between ADAM22 and 14-3-3 proteins, which is implicated in neurological diseases, and a circadian regulatory loop involving RORB and NR1D1. The hybrid GNN-LLM method analyzes biomedical literature efficiency to uncover potential molecular interactions for complex disorders. It can accelerate therapeutic target discovery by focusing expert verification on the most relevant automatically extracted information.",https://openalex.org/W4404048128,2024,Timofey Ivanisenko; П.

Ontology mapping using bipartite graph,"Fast improvement of web technologies have caused a problem of semantic integration between distributed applications. In this respect, sharing and distribution of information are of vital importance for ontologies. Ontologies may be improved by any independent association and still be used by another association. In case an association decides to use an ontology improved by another association, they should make mapping between ontology concepts. Different worldviews assign different meanings to different concepts and defines them differently. Therefore, mapping stands as an inevitable process. Mapping is the job of finding objects that are compatible between two ontologies. Semantic mapping of ontologies by means of bipartite graph matching algorithms has been studied in this paper. A mapping system defined as  has been improved. We have named this system BGOM (bipartite graph optimal mapping). BGOM system finds the one-to-one matching between ontologies  and  which are in similar domains or in same domain. Firstly, two data matrices for ontology concepts  and  have been obtained. Next, a score matrix has been obtained from general data matrixes by using Levensthein metric. Finally, Kuhn-Munkres optimal assignment algorithm has been used to optimally map the concepts between  and. The reason for this is to find one-to-one matches of concepts in the model we have improved. Kuhn-Munkres algorithm is an effective way to find the most similar couples (Tassa, 2007). Consequently, a one-to-one optimal map has been obtained between source and target ontologies. Application, prediction capability and truth values of BGOM system is evaluated by ontology alignment evaluation initiative (OAEI1) and satisfactory results have been obtained. Precision, recall and f-measure values of alignment results in the system we have improved, and are compared to the other systems in OAEI campaign and considerably good results have been obtained. Application of BGOM system between source and target ontologies has assisted effectively for solution of ontology mapping problem.

Differences in graph-related practices between high school biology textbooks and scientific ecology journals,"Our research program is concerned with the trajectory of individuals from their initial participation in science-related activities to their full participation in scientific research. This study was designed to provide answers to questions about (a) the practices required for reading graphs in high school textbooks and scientific journals, and (b) the role of high school textbooks in the appropriation of authentic scientific graph-related practices. For our analyses, we selected five leading ecology-related journals and six representative high school biology textbooks. Although there were no differences in the total number of inscriptions used in journals and textbooks, there were significant differences in the frequency with which Cartesian graphs were used. To allow more detailed analyses, an ontology of graphs was developed. Our fine-grained analyses based on this ontology yielded qualitative differences between the uses of graphs and associated captions and main text as they appeared in high school textbooks and scientific journals. Scientific journals provided more resources to facilitate graph reading and more elaborate descriptions and interpretations of graphs than the high school textbooks. Implications of this study are outlined as they relate to (a) producing graphs, captions, and main text in high school textbooks; and (b) teaching and researching graph-related practices from anthropological perspectives. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Enhancing Text Retrieval Performance using Conceptual Ontological Graph,"Most of the data representation techniques are based on word and/or phrase analysis of the text. The statistical analysis of a term (word or phrase) frequency captures the importance of the term within a document. However, to achieve a more accurate analysis, the underlying data representation should indicate terms that capture the semantics of the text from which the importance of a term in a sentence and in the document can be derived. A new concept-based representation that relies on the analysis of the sentence semantics, rather than, the traditional analysis of the document dataset only is introduced. The proposed conceptual ontological graph representation denotes the terms which contribute to the sentence semantics. Then, each term is chosen based on its position in the proposed representation. Lastly, the selected terms are associated to their documents as features for the purpose of indexing in the text retrieval. Experiments using the proposed conceptual ontological graph representation in text retrieval are conducted. The evaluation of results is relied on two quality measures, the precision and the recall. Both of these quality measures improved when the newly developed representation is used to enhance the performance of the text retrieval",https://openalex.org/W2107134232,2006,Shady Shehata; Fakhri Karray; Mohamed S.

Visualizing the Evolution of Ontologies: A Dynamic Graph Perspective.,"Ontologies can be represented as graphs, since they essentially comprise a set of interconnected concepts describing a certain field of knowledge. Consequently, ontologies are often visualized as graphs, using different visual notations and common graph drawing techniques. The visualization of static graphs has been researched a lot, but when it comes to time-varying graphs, researchers face much more challenges in order to design useful, readable, and intuitive visualizations. If we have to deal with dynamic, i.e., evolving and time-dependent ontologies, we have to adapt existing visualization techniques to this challenging problem or develop new ones. In this position paper, we take a look at the visual representation of time-varying ontologies, and provide a discussion from a dynamic graph visualization perspective.",https://openalex.org/W2394656362,2015,Michael Burch; Steffen Lohmann,

GEL: A Platform-Independent Reasoner for Parallel Classification with OWL EL Ontologies Using Graph Representation,"In the community of Semantic Web, the state-of-the-art reasoners are all implemented on specific platforms. As the Web Ontology Language (OWL) has been widely used in different real-world applications, it is required that the task of reasoning can be flexibly adapted to different platforms. In this paper, we take the first effort to give a platformindependent approach for parallel classification of the description logic OWL EL, which is a tractable fragment of OWL 2. Classification, which is the task of computing a subsumption hierarchy between concepts, plays an important role in many applications of OWL EL. The current classification methods rely on the specific parallel computation platforms and can hardly achieve a tradeoff between efficiency and scalability. To develop a platform-independent approach for performing classification in OWL EL, we first give a novel and well defined graph formalism GEL for representing EL ontologies and present a group of sound and complete rules for ontology classification on a GEL graph. Based on this formalism, we design a parallel classification algorithm, which can be implemented on different parallel computation platforms, and we also show the correctness of the algorithm. We implement a system, which can easily switch between multi-core and a distributed cluster. Finally, we conduct experiments on several real-world OWL EL ontologies. The experimental results show that our system outperforms two state-of-the-art EL reasoning systems, and has a linear scalability on the extensions of GO ontologies.",https://openalex.org/W2594328753,2017,Zhangquan Zhou; Guilin Qi,Southeast University
"Data-Driven Construction Safety Information Sharing System Based on Linked Data, Ontologies, and Knowledge Graph Technologies","Accident, injury, and fatality rates remain disproportionately high in the construction industry. Information from past mishaps provides an opportunity to acquire insights, gather lessons learned, and systematically improve safety outcomes. Advances in data science and industry 4.0 present new unprecedented opportunities for the industry to leverage, share, and reuse safety information more efficiently. However, potential benefits of information sharing are missed due to accident data being inconsistently formatted, non-machine-readable, and inaccessible. Hence, learning opportunities and insights cannot be captured and disseminated to proactively prevent accidents. To address these issues, a novel information sharing system is proposed utilizing linked data, ontologies, and knowledge graph technologies. An ontological approach is developed to semantically model safety information and formalize knowledge pertaining to accident cases. A multi-algorithmic approach is developed for automatically processing and converting accident case data to a resource description framework (RDF), and the SPARQL protocol is deployed to enable query functionalities. Trials and test scenarios utilizing a dataset of 200 real accident cases confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the system in improving information access, retrieval, and reusability. The proposed development facilitates a new “open” information sharing paradigm with major implications for industry 4.0 and data-driven applications in construction safety management.",https://openalex.org/W4205410021,2022,Akeem Pedro; Anh-Tuan Pham-Hang; Phong Thanh Nguyen,Imperial College London; Ho Chi Minh City International University; Ho Chi Minh City Open University
Controlling Access to a Digital Library Ontology - A Graph Transformation Approach,"This paper presents a graph-based formalism for an Ontology Based Access Control (OBAC) system applied to Digital Library (DL) ontology. It uses graph transformations, a graphical specication technique based on a generalization of classical string grammars to nonlinear structures. The proposed formalism provides an executable specication that exploits existing tools of graph grammar to verify the properties of a graph-based access control mechanism applicable to a digital library ontology description. It also provides a uniform specication for controlling access not only at the concept level but also at the level of the documents covered by the concepts including node obfuscation, if required. Authors have shown the need of using both positive and negative authorizations for eective access control to the DL ontology. However, it gives rise to a decidability problem.

Disease Ontology: a backbone for disease semantic integration,"The Disease Ontology (DO) database (http://disease-ontology.org) represents a comprehensive knowledge base of 8043 inherited, developmental and acquired human diseases (DO version 3, revision 2510). The DO web browser has been designed for speed, efficiency and robustness through the use of a graph database. Full-text contextual searching functionality using Lucene allows the querying of name, synonym, definition, DOID and cross-reference (xrefs) with complex Boolean search strings. The DO semantically integrates disease and medical vocabularies through extensive cross mapping and integration of MeSH, ICD, NCI's thesaurus, SNOMED CT and OMIM disease-specific terms and identifiers. The DO is utilized for disease annotation by major biomedical databases (e.g. Array Express, NIF, IEDB), as a standard representation of human disease in biomedical ontologies (e.g. IDO, Cell line ontology, NIFSTD ontology, Experimental Factor Ontology, Influenza Ontology), and as an ontological cross mappings resource between DO, MeSH and OMIM (e.g. GeneWiki). The DO project (http://diseaseontology.sf.net) has been incorporated into open source tools (e.g. Gene Answers, FunDO) to connect gene and disease biomedical data through the lens of human disease.

Knowledge Graphs’ Ontologies and Applications for Energy Efficiency in Buildings: A Review,"The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry has been utilizing Decision Support Systems (DSSs) for a long time to support energy efficiency improvements in the different phases of a building’s life cycle. In this context, there has been a need for a proper means of exchanging and managing of different kinds of data (e.g., geospatial data, sensor data, 2D/3D models data, material data, schedules, regulatory, financial data) by different kinds of stakeholders and end users, i.e., planners, architects, engineers, property owners and managers. DSSs are used to support various processes inherent in the various building life cycle phases including planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance, retrofitting and demolishing. Such tools are in some cases based on established technologies such Building Information Models, Big Data analysis and other more advanced approaches, including Internet of Things applications and semantic web technologies. In this framework, semantic web technologies form the basis of a new technological paradigm, known as the knowledge graphs (KG), which is a powerful technique concerning the structured semantic representation of the elements of a building and their relationships, offering significant benefits for data exploitation in creating new knowledge. In this paper, a review of the main ontologies and applications that support the development of DSSs and decision making in the different phases of a building’s life cycle is conducted. Our aim is to present a thorough analysis of the state of the art and advancements in the field, to explore key constituents and methodologies, to highlight critical aspects and characteristics, to elaborate on critical thinking and considerations, and to evaluate potential impact of KG applications towards the decision-making processes associated with the energy transition in the built environment.",https://openalex.org/W4304761855,2022,Filippos Lygerakis; Nikos Kampelis; Dionysia Kolokotsa,Technical University of Crete
Formal Definition of a General Ontology Pattern Language using a Graph Grammar,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of ontologica! theories in the philosophical sense (Foundational Ontologies) to analyze and (re)design conceptual modeling languages. This paper is about an ontologically well-founded conceptual modeling language in this tradition, termed OntoUML. This language embeds a number of ontological patterns that reflect the micro-theories comprising a particular foundational ontology named UFO. We here (re)define OntoUML as a formal graph grammar and demonstrate how the models of this language can be constructed by the combined application of ontological patterns following a number of graph transformation rules. As a result, we obtain a version of this language fully defined as a formal Ontology Pattern Grammar. In other words, this paper presents a formal definition of OntoUML that is both explicit in terms of the ontological patterns that it incorporates and is completely independent of the UML meta-model.",https://openalex.org/W2759063855,2017,Eduardo Zambon; Giancarlo Guizzardi,Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano
Improving the Computational Performance of Ontology-Based Classification Using Graph Databases,"The increasing availability of very high-resolution remote sensing imagery (i.e., from satellites, airborne laser scanning, or aerial photography) represents both a blessing and a curse for researchers. The manual classification of these images, or other similar geo-sensor data, is time-consuming and leads to subjective and non-deterministic results. Due to this fact, (semi-) automated classification approaches are in high demand in affected research areas. Ontologies provide a proper way of automated classification for various kinds of sensor data, including remotely sensed data. However, the processing of data entities—so-called individuals—is one of the most cost-intensive computational operations within ontology reasoning. Therefore, an approach based on graph databases is proposed to overcome the issue of a high time consumption regarding the classification task. The introduced approach shifts the classification task from the classical Protégé environment and its common reasoners to the proposed graph-based approaches. For the validation, the authors tested the approach on a simulation scenario based on a real-world example. The results demonstrate a quite promising improvement of classification speed—up to 80,000 times faster than the Protégé-based approach.",https://openalex.org/W1497948086,2015,Thomas J.

A Hidden Markov Model Approach to Testing Multiple Hypotheses on a Tree-Transformed Gene Ontology Graph,Gene category testing problems involve testing hundreds of null hypotheses that correspond to nodes in a directed acyclic graph. The logical relationships among the nodes in the graph imply that only some configurations of true and false null hypotheses are possible and that a test for a given node should depend on data from neighboring nodes. We developed a method based on a hidden Markov model that takes the whole graph into account and provides coherent decisions in this structured multiple hypothesis testing problem. The method is illustrated by testing Gene Ontology terms for evidence of differential expression.,https://openalex.org/W2035923145,2010,Kun Liang; Dan Nettleton,Iowa State University; U.S. National Science Foundation
A GRAPH-BASED SEMANTIC SIMILARITY MEASURE FOR THE GENE ONTOLOGY,"Existing methods for calculating semantic similarities between pairs of Gene Ontology (GO) terms and gene products often rely on external databases like Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) that annotate gene products using the GO terms. This dependency leads to some limitations in real applications. Here, we present a semantic similarity algorithm (SSA), that relies exclusively on the GO. When calculating the semantic similarity between a pair of input GO terms, SSA takes into account the shortest path between them, the depth of their nearest common ancestor, and a novel similarity score calculated between the definitions of the involved GO terms. In our work, we use SSA to calculate semantic similarities between pairs of proteins by combining pairwise semantic similarities between the GO terms that annotate the involved proteins. The reliability of SSA was evaluated by comparing the resulting semantic similarities between proteins with the functional similarities between proteins derived from expert annotations or sequence similarity. Comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods showed that SSA is highly competitive with the other methods. SSA provides a reliable measure for semantics similarity independent of external databases of functional-annotation observations.",https://openalex.org/W2025452874,2011,Marco Álvarez; Changhui Yan,Utah State University; North Dakota State University
From knowledge graph embedding to ontology embedding? An analysis of the compatibility between vector space representations and rules,"Recent years have witnessed the successful application of
low-dimensional vector space representations of knowledge
graphs to predict missing facts or find erroneous ones. However,
it is not yet well-understood to what extent ontological
knowledge, e.g. given as a set of (existential) rules, can be
embedded in a principled way. To address this shortcoming,
in this paper we introduce a general framework based on a
view of relations as regions, which allows us to study the
compatibility between ontological knowledge and different
types of vector space embeddings. Our technical contribution
is two-fold. First, we show that some of the most popular existing
embedding methods are not capable of modelling even
very simple types of rules, which in particular also means that
they are not able to learn the type of dependencies captured by
such rules. Second, we study a model in which relations are
modelled as convex regions. We show particular that ontologies
which are expressed using so-called quasi-chained existential
rules can be exactly represented using convex regions,
such that any set of facts which is induced using that vector
space embedding is logically consistent and deductively
closed with respect to the input ontology.",https://openalex.org/W2962819387,2018,Víctor Gutiérrez Basulto; Steven Schockaert,Cardiff University
Ontological Approach to a Knowledge Graph Construction in a Semantic Library,"The paper considers an approach to a knowledge graph construction based on the ontological representation of scientific subject areas. The presentation is based on concepts related to information and data mining, such as knowledge, knowledge extraction, domain ontology, scientific domain, thesaurus, semantic digital library, user information need, ontological design method and, in fact, the knowledge graph. The digital semantic library LibMeta is presented as a repository of various structured data with the possibility of their integration with other data sources. Assumes the possibility of specifying personal content by describing a local subject area within LibMeta. The ontology of the content of the semantic library acts as a means of formalization. This paper addresses the experience of building semantic libraries based on thesauri and ontological design. Building ontologies based on the thesaurus of the subject area LibMeta allows us to say that the presence of internal semantic links ensures the consistency and reliability of search results, which is a necessary condition for extracting scientific knowledge. The digital library ontology defines the data structure of the library content. Each data element loaded into the library can be associated with an ontology vertex (top) that determines the position of the data element in the ontology. Based on the ontology links and the links defined at the design stage, you can build a data graph. On the example of the ontology of the LibMeta semantic library, the technology of forming the knowledge graph of modern applications in mathematics is discussed. The problems of filling a graph, embedding in a graph, extracting links and nodes of a graph are discussed.",https://openalex.org/W4387316367,2023,Olga Muratovna Ataeva; V. A. Serebryakov; N. P.

DeepGOA: Predicting Gene Ontology Annotations of Proteins via Graph Convolutional Network,"Gene Ontology (GO) uses a series of standardized and controlled GO terms to describe the molecular functions, biological process roles and cellular locations of gene products (i.e., proteins and RNAs), it structurally organizes GO terms in a direct acyclic graph (DAG). GO has more than 40000 terms and each protein is only annotated with several or dozens of these terms. It is a difficult challenge to accurately annotate relevant GO terms to a protein from such a large number of candidate GO terms. Some deep learning models have been proposed to utilize the GO hierarchy for protein function prediction, but they inadequately utilize GO hierarchy. To use the knowledge encoded in the GO hierarchy, we propose a deep Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model (DeepGOA) to predict GO annotations of proteins. DeepGOA firstly utilizes GO annotations and hierarchy to measure the correlations between GO terms and to accordingly update the edge weights of the DAG, and then applies GCN on the updated DAG to learn the semantic representation and latent inter-relations of GO terms. At the same time, it uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn the feature representation of amino acids sequences with respect to the semantic representations. After that, DeepGOA computes the dot product of two representations, which enables training the whole network end-to-end in a coherent fashion. Experiments on two model species (Human and Corn) show that DeepGOA outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning based methods. The ablation study proves that GCN can employ the knowledge of GO and boost the performance.",https://openalex.org/W3005335133,2019,Guangjie Zhou; Jun Wang; Xiangliang Zhang,Southwest University; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology

Chemical reaction network knowledge graphs: the OntoRXN ontology,"Abstract The organization and management of large amounts of data has become a major point in almost all areas of human knowledge. In this context, semantic approaches propose a structure for the target data, defining ontologies that state the types of entities on a certain field and how these entities are interrelated. In this work, we introduce OntoRXN, a novel ontology describing the reaction networks constructed from computational chemistry calculations. Under our paradigm, these networks are handled as undirected graphs, without assuming any traversal direction. From there, we propose a core class structure including reaction steps, network stages, chemical species, and the lower-level entities for the individual computational calculations. These individual calculations are founded on the OntoCompChem ontology and on the ioChem-BD database, where information is parsed and stored in CML format. OntoRXN is introduced through several examples in which knowledge graphs based on the ontology are generated for different chemical systems available on ioChem-BD. Finally, the resulting knowledge graphs are explored through SPARQL queries, illustrating the power of the semantic approach to standardize the analysis of intricate datasets and to simplify the development of complex workflows.

Ontologies can support a variety of purposes, ranging from capturing conceptual knowledge to the organisation of digital content and information. However, information systems are always subject to change and ontology change management can pose challenges. We investigate ontology change representation and discovery of change patterns. Ontology changes are formalised as graph-based change logs. We use attributed graphs, which are typed over a generic graph with node and edge attribution. We analyse ontology change logs, represented as graphs, and identify frequent change sequences. Such sequences are applied as a reference in order to discover reusable, often domain-specific and usagedriven change patterns. We describe the pattern discovery algorithms and measure their performance using experimental results.",https://openalex.org/W143156466,2011,Muhammad Javed; Yalemisew Abgaz; Claus Pahl,Dublin City University
Graph-based ontology analysis in the linked open data,"The Linked Open Data (LOD) includes over 31 billion Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples interlinked by around 504 million SameAs links (as of September 2011). The data sets of the LOD use different ontologies to describe instances, that cause the ontology heterogeneity problem. Dealing with the heterogeneous ontologies is a challenging problem and it is time-consuming to manually learn big ontologies in the LOD. The heterogeneity of ontologies in the LOD can be reduced by automatically integrating related ontology classes and properties, which can be retrieved from interlinked instances. The interlinked instances can be represented as an undirected graph, from which we can discover the characteristics of instances and retrieve related ontology classes and properties that are important for linking instances. In this paper, we retrieve graph patterns from several linked data sets and perform ontology alignment methods on each graph pattern to identify related ontology classes and properties from the data sets. We successfully integrate various ontologies, analyze the characteristics of interlinked instances, and detect mistaken properties in the real data sets. Furthermore, our approach solves the ontology heterogeneity problem and helps Semantic Web application developers easily query on various data sets with the integrated ontology.",https://openalex.org/W2005049675,2012,Lihua Zhao; Ryutaro Ichise,National Institute of Informatics
Clustering rare diseases within an ontology-enriched knowledge graph,"Abstract Objective Identifying sets of rare diseases with shared aspects of etiology and pathophysiology may enable drug repurposing. Toward that aim, we utilized an integrative knowledge graph to construct clusters of rare diseases. Materials and Methods Data on 3242 rare diseases were extracted from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science Genetic and Rare Diseases Information center internal data resources. The rare disease data enriched with additional biomedical data, including gene and phenotype ontologies, biological pathway data, and small molecule-target activity data, to create a knowledge graph (KG). Node embeddings were trained and clustered. We validated the disease clusters through semantic similarity and feature enrichment analysis. Results Thirty-seven disease clusters were created with a mean size of 87 diseases. We validate the clusters quantitatively via semantic similarity based on the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology. In addition, the clusters were analyzed for enrichment of associated genes, revealing that the enriched genes within clusters are highly related. Discussion We demonstrate that node embeddings are an effective method for clustering diseases within a heterogenous KG. Semantically similar diseases and relevant enriched genes have been uncovered within the clusters. Connections between disease clusters and drugs are enumerated for follow-up efforts. Conclusion We lay out a method for clustering rare diseases using graph node embeddings. We develop an easy-to-maintain pipeline that can be updated when new data on rare diseases emerges. The embeddings themselves can be paired with other representation learning methods for other data types, such as drugs, to address other predictive modeling problems.",https://openalex.org/W4387116288,2023,Jaleal Sanjak; Jessica Binder; Arjun Singh Yadaw,Booz Allen Hamilton (United States); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; National Institutes of Health
Enumerating consistent sub-graphs of directed acyclic graphs: an insight into biomedical ontologies,"Abstract Motivation Modern problems of concept annotation associate an object of interest (gene, individual, text document) with a set of interrelated textual descriptors (functions, diseases, topics), often organized in concept hierarchies or ontologies. Most ontology can be seen as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent concepts and edges represent relational ties between these concepts. Given an ontology graph, each object can only be annotated by a consistent sub-graph; that is, a sub-graph such that if an object is annotated by a particular concept, it must also be annotated by all other concepts that generalize it. Ontologies therefore provide a compact representation of a large space of possible consistent sub-graphs; however, until now we have not been aware of a practical algorithm that can enumerate such annotation spaces for a given ontology. Results We propose an algorithm for enumerating consistent sub-graphs of DAGs. The algorithm recursively partitions the graph into strictly smaller graphs until the resulting graph becomes a rooted tree (forest), for which a linear-time solution is computed. It then combines the tallies from graphs created in the recursion to obtain the final count. We prove the correctness of this algorithm, propose several practical accelerations, evaluate it on random graphs and then apply it to characterize four major biomedical ontologies. We believe this work provides valuable insights into the complexity of concept annotation spaces and its potential influence on the predictability of ontological annotation.

From UML Class Diagrams to OWL Ontologies: A Graph Transformation Based Approach.,"Abstract. Models are placed by modeling paradigm at the center of development process. These models are represented by languages, like UML the language standardized by the OMG which became necessary for development. Moreover the ontology engineering paradigm places ontologies at the center of development process, in this paradigm we find OWL (the description language adopted by a great community of users) the principal language for knowledge representation. The bridging between UML and OWL appeared on several regards such as the classes and associations. In this paper, we propose an approach based graph transformation and registered in the MDA architecture for the automatic generation of OWL ontologies from UML class diagrams. The transformation is based on transformation rules; the level of abstraction in these rules is close to the application in order to have usable ontologies.",https://openalex.org/W2403798309,2012,Aissam Belghiat; Mustapha Bourahla,
"OK Google, What Is Your Ontology? Or: Exploring Freebase Classification to Understand Google's Knowledge Graph","This paper reconstructs the Freebase data dumps to understand the underlying ontology behind Google's semantic search feature. The Freebase knowledge base was a major Semantic Web and linked data technology that was acquired by Google in 2010 to support the Google Knowledge Graph, the backend for Google search results that include structured answers to queries instead of a series of links to external resources. After its shutdown in 2016, Freebase is contained in a data dump of 1.9 billion Resource Description Format (RDF) triples. A recomposition of the Freebase ontology will be analyzed in relation to concepts and insights from the literature on classification by Bowker and Star. This paper will explore how the Freebase ontology is shaped by many of the forces that also shape classification systems through a deep dive into the ontology and a small correlational study. These findings will provide a glimpse into the proprietary blackbox Knowledge Graph and what is meant by Google's mission to ""organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"".",https://openalex.org/W2799428943,2018,Niel Chah,
Matching Biomedical Ontologies via a Hybrid Graph Attention Network,"Biomedical ontologies have been used extensively to formally define and organize biomedical terminologies, and these ontologies are typically manually created by biomedical experts. With more biomedical ontologies being built independently, matching them to address the problem of heterogeneity and interoperability has become a critical challenge in many biomedical applications. Existing matching methods have mostly focused on capturing features of terminological, structural, and contextual semantics in ontologies. However, these feature engineering-based techniques are not only labor-intensive but also ignore the hidden semantic relations in ontologies. In this study, we propose an alternative biomedical ontology-matching framework BioHAN via a hybrid graph attention network, and that consists of three techniques. First, we propose an effective ontology-enriching method that refines and enriches the ontologies through axioms and external resources. Subsequently, we use hyperbolic graph attention layers to encode hierarchical concepts in a unified hyperbolic space. Finally, we aggregate the features of both the direct and distant neighbors with a graph attention network. Experimental results on real-world biomedical ontologies demonstrate that BioHAN is competitive with the state-of-the-art ontology matching methods.",https://openalex.org/W4286487960,2022,Peng Wang; Yunyan Hu,Southeast University

Metacoder: An R package for visualization and manipulation of community taxonomic diversity data,"Community-level data, the type generated by an increasing number of metabarcoding studies, is often graphed as stacked bar charts or pie graphs that use color to represent taxa. These graph types do not convey the hierarchical structure of taxonomic classifications and are limited by the use of color for categories. As an alternative, we developed metacoder, an R package for easily parsing, manipulating, and graphing publication-ready plots of hierarchical data. Metacoder includes a dynamic and flexible function that can parse most text-based formats that contain taxonomic classifications, taxon names, taxon identifiers, or sequence identifiers. Metacoder can then subset, sample, and order this parsed data using a set of intuitive functions that take into account the hierarchical nature of the data. Finally, an extremely flexible plotting function enables quantitative representation of up to 4 arbitrary statistics simultaneously in a tree format by mapping statistics to the color and size of tree nodes and edges. Metacoder also allows exploration of barcode primer bias by integrating functions to run digital PCR. Although it has been designed for data from metabarcoding research, metacoder can easily be applied to any data that has a hierarchical component such as gene ontology or geographic location data. Our package complements currently available tools for community analysis and is provided open source with an extensive online user manual.",https://openalex.org/W2510766756,2017,Zachary Foster; Thomas J.

From Knowledge Graph Embedding to Ontology Embedding? An Analysis of the Compatibility between Vector Space Representations and Rules,"Recent years have witnessed the successful application of low-dimensional vector space representations of knowledge graphs to predict missing facts or find erroneous ones. However, it is not yet well-understood to what extent ontological knowledge, e.g. given as a set of (existential) rules, can be embedded in a principled way. To address this shortcoming, in this paper we introduce a general framework based on a view of relations as regions, which allows us to study the compatibility between ontological knowledge and different types of vector space embeddings. Our technical contribution is two-fold. First, we show that some of the most popular existing embedding methods are not capable of modelling even very simple types of rules, which in particular also means that they are not able to learn the type of dependencies captured by such rules. Second, we study a model in which relations are modelled as convex regions. We show particular that ontologies which are expressed using so-called quasi-chained existential rules can be exactly represented using convex regions, such that any set of facts which is induced using that vector space embedding is logically consistent and deductively closed with respect to the input ontology.",https://openalex.org/W2886905685,2018,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto; Steven Schockaert,

We propose an ontology of tags in which tags are modelled as named graphs. These named graphs are made of a resource linked to a “sign” which can be any resource reachable on the Web (an ontology concept, an image, etc.). The purpose of our model is to be able to describe tags in a very general manner, and as an immediate consequence, to describe tags as modelled by other tag models (SCOT, CommonTag, etc.). Our tag model can thus be seen as a bridge between the manifold conceptualizations and instantiations of tags’s models currently available on the Web.",https://openalex.org/W186907021,2009,Freddy Limpens; Alexandre Monnin; David Laniado,
Learning Knowledge Using Frequent Subgraph Mining from Ontology Graph Data,"In many areas, vast amounts of information are rapidly accumulating in the form of ontology-based knowledge graphs, and the use of information in these forms of knowledge graphs is becoming increasingly important. This study proposes a novel method for efficiently learning frequent subgraphs (i.e., knowledge) from ontology-based graph data. An ontology-based large-scale graph is decomposed into small unit subgraphs, which are used as the unit to calculate the frequency of the subgraph. The frequent subgraphs are extracted through candidate generation and chunking processes. To verify the usefulness of the extracted frequent subgraphs, the methodology was applied to movie rating prediction. Using the frequent subgraphs as user profiles, the graph similarity between the rating graph and new item graph was calculated to predict the rating. The MovieLens dataset was used for the experiment, and a comparison showed that the proposed method outperformed other widely used recommendation methods. This study is meaningful in that it proposed an efficient method for extracting frequent subgraphs while maintaining semantic information and considering scalability in large-scale graphs. Furthermore, the proposed method can provide results that include semantic information to serve as a logical basis for rating prediction or recommendation, which existing methods are unable to provide.",https://openalex.org/W3125962629,2021,Kwangyon Lee; Haemin Jung; June Seok Hong,Yonsei University; Kyonggi University
Automatic topic labelling for text document using ontology of graph-based concepts and dependency graph,"Topic labelling is an important task of text mining.

Graph-based ontology-guided data mining for D-matrix model maturation,"In model-based diagnostic algorithms, it is assumed that the model is correct. If the model is incorrect, the diagnostic algorithm may diagnose the wrong fault, which can be costly and time consuming. Using past maintenance events, one should be able to make corrections to the model in order for diagnostic algorithm to correctly diagnosis faults. In this paper, a maturation approach is proposed which uses the graph-theoretic representations of Timed Failure Propagation Graph (TFPG) models and diagnostic sessions based on recently standardized diagnostic ontologies to determine statistical discrepancies between that which is expected by the models and that which has been encountered in practice. These discrepancies are then analyzed to generate recommendations for maturing the diagnostic models. Maturation recommendations include identifying new dependencies and erroneous or tenuous dependencies.",https://openalex.org/W2110384646,2011,Shane Strasser; John W. Sheppard; Michael A.

Experiences with creating a Precision Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO) and a Knowledge Graph for the Data Integration Platform in agriOpenLink,"One of the central problems in creating information management solutions for precision dairy farming is integration and interpretation of heterogeneous data coming from different equipment and data sources. Establishing a unifying data model is recognized as a cornerstone to such solutions. Here, the challenge lies both in agreeing on a common information context, and in selecting appropriate model representations, model query and update techniques, which guarantee model extensibility. While already existing ISOagriNET Data Dictionaries capture broad variety of the livestock and dairy farming concepts, the existing model representation technics cannot support efficient model extension. In this paper, we present our experience with using the representation and query standards and tools of the Semantic Web, endorsed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), in particular the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Web Ontology Language (OWL), and the SPARQL query standard, to encode and manipulate the dairy farming domain knowledge in a form of the Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO). Within the research project agriOpenLink the DFO has been created in two phases. The first phase focused on using the Semantic Web tools to facilitate easy encoding and manipulation of the dairy farming domain knowledge and the platform operational data models. The second phase focused on translating ISOagriNET Data Dictionaries into their semantic representations. Resulting DFO is maintained in a semantic repository, and it presents a knowledge graph and as integration backbone for the agriOpenLink decision support platform.",https://openalex.org/W2462163697,2015,Dana Tomic; Domagoj Drenjanac; Sandra Hoermann,Josephinum Research
Indoor and Outdoor 3D Scene Graph Generation Via Language-Enabled Spatial Ontologies,"This paper proposes an approach to build 3D scene graphs in arbitrary indoor and outdoor environments. Such extension is challenging; the hierarchy of concepts that describe an outdoor environment is more complex than for indoors, and manually defining such hierarchy is time-consuming and does not scale. Furthermore, the lack of training data prevents the straightforward application of learning-based tools used in indoor settings. To address these challenges, we propose two novel extensions. First, we develop methods to build a <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">spatial ontology</i> defining concepts and relations relevant for indoor and outdoor robot operation. In particular, we use a Large Language Model (LLM) to build such an ontology, thus largely reducing the amount of manual effort required. Second, we leverage the spatial ontology for 3D scene graph construction using <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">Logic Tensor Networks</i> (LTN) to add logical rules, or <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">axioms</i> (e.g., ""a beach contains sand""), which provide additional supervisory signals at training time thus reducing the need for labelled data, providing better predictions, and even allowing predicting concepts unseen at training time. We test our approach in a variety of datasets, including indoor, rural, and coastal environments, and show that it leads to a significant increase in the quality of the 3D scene graph generation with sparsely annotated data.",https://openalex.org/W4393372075,2024,Jared Strader; Nathan Hughes; W.

A graph-based approach for resolving incoherent ontology mappings,"Ontology mappings are regarded as the semantic bridges that link entities from different yet overlapping ontologies in order to support knowledge sharing and reuse on the Semantic Web. However, mappings can be wrong and result in logical conflicts among ontologies. Such kind of mappings are called incoherent mappings. As an important part of ontology matching, mapping validation aims at detecting the conflicts and restoring the coherence of mappings. In this paper, we propose a graph-based approach which is complete for detecting incoherent mappings among DL-Lite ontologies. The lightweight DL-Lite family of description logics stand out for tractable reasoning and efficient query answering capabilities. Our approach consists of a set of graph construction rules, a graph-based incoherence detection algorithm, and a graph-based incoherence repair algorithm. We propose and formalize three repair principles in an attempt to measure the wrong mappings, where the notion of common closures w.r.t. a mapping arc in the constructed graph is introduced. These principles feature a global removal strategy that is independent of individual ontology matchers. In order to relieve the loss of information among ontologies in the repair process, we further define a mapping revision operator so that common closures related to the removed mappings can be preserved in the graph. We implement the graph-based algorithms and evaluate their performance in a comparison with state-of-the-art systems on real-world ontologies. Experimental results show that our approach can remove more wrong mappings and achieve better repairing results in most of the cases.",https://openalex.org/W2792140082,2018,Weizhuo Li; Songmao Zhang; Guilin Qi,Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences
A Generic Ontology Framework for Indexing Keyword Search on Massive Graphs,"Due to the unstructuredness and the lack of schema information of knowledge graphs, social networks and RDF graphs, keyword search has been proposed for querying such graphs/networks. Recently, various keyword search semantics have been designed. In this paper, we propose a generic ontology-based indexing framework for keyword search, called Bisimulation of Generalized Graph Index (BiG-index), to enhance the search performance. The novelties of BiG-index reside in using an ontology graph G(Ont) to summarize and index a data graph G iteratively, to form a hierarchical index structure G. BiG-index is generic since it only requires keyword search algorithms to generate query answers from summary graphs having two simple properties. Regarding query evaluation, we transform a keyword search q into Q according to G(Ont) in runtime. The transformed query is searched on the summary graphs in G. The efficiency is due to the small sizes of the summary graphs and the early pruning of semantically irrelevant subgraphs. To illustrate BiG-index's applicability, we show popular indexing techniques for keyword search (e.g., Blinks and r-clique) can be easily implemented on top of BiG-index. Our extensive experiments show that BiG-index reduced the runtimes of popular keyword search work Blinks by 50.5 percent and r-clique by 29.5 percent.",https://openalex.org/W2990016312,2019,Jiaxin Jiang; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,Hong Kong Baptist University
STIX-based Network Security Knowledge Graph Ontology Modeling Method,"Network security incidents are complex and unstructured, making them difficult to understand and share. In this paper, we analyzes the commonality between structured threat information representation (STIX) and network security domain knowledge, and proposes a knowledge graph ontology modeling method of network security based on STIX. With the architecture knowledge of STIX, this method generates an ontology schema of network security knowledge graph, through classifying the concepts in the field of network security, describing the attributes of concepts and combing the relationships between concepts. The ontology schema has small redundancy and strong structural hierarchy, and can clearly display the structure of the attack activity and the mutual relationship. Therefore, it can help decision makers to understand security incidents more deeply, and help them make reasonable decisions and share cyber threat intelligence.",https://openalex.org/W3039697228,2020,Zhengjun Liu; Sun Zhi; Jianfeng Chen,

All database entries are now 'is_a' classified within the ontology, meaning that all of the chemicals are available to semantic reasoning tools that harness the classification hierarchy. We have completely aligned the ontology with the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry-recommended upper level Basic Formal Ontology. Furthermore, we have aligned our chemical classification with the classification of chemical-involving processes in the Gene Ontology (GO), and as a result of this effort, the majority of chemical-involving processes in GO are now defined in terms of the ChEBI entities that participate in them. This effort necessitated incorporating many additional biologically relevant compounds.

A graph-based approach to measuring semantic relatedness in ontologies,"The need of determining the degree of semantic similarity, relatedness or distance between two concepts within the same ontology or two different ontologies is becoming an increasingly important task in the field of Information Retrieval. Although a great attention has been paid to design semantic similarity/relatedness methods based on taxonomies, there has been little discussion about the design of semantic similarity/relatedness methods based on ontologies. In this paper we introduce a novel graph-based semantic relatedness approach to calculate semantic relatedness considering both hierarchical and non-hierarchical concepts in an ontology. In addition, our approach considers some important properties such as different relation types, concepts' depth and distance that play an essential role in measuring semantic relatedness. Three experimental studies are provided to first illustrate that our approach give a different results than other measures in the literature. Then, we compare our approach against existed methods using a benchmark dataset, and finally, evaluate our approach by using a real ontology and compare the predictions of our semantic relatedness approach against the human-subject judgment.

Ontology Mapping Using Fuzzy Conceptual Graphs and Rules.,"The reassignment of stop codons is common among many ciliate species. For example, Tetrahymena species recognize only UGA as a stop codon, while Euplotes species recognize only UAA and UAG as stop codons. Recent studies have shown that domain 1 of the translation termination factor eRF1 mediates stop codon recognition. While it is commonly assumed that changes in domain 1 of ciliate eRF1s are responsible for altered stop codon recognition, this has never been demonstrated in vivo. To carry out such an analysis, we made hybrid proteins that contained eRF1 domain 1 from either Tetrahymena thermophila or Euplotes octocarinatus fused to eRF1 domains 2 and 3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the Tetrahymena hybrid eRF1 efficiently terminated at all three stop codons when expressed in yeast cells, indicating that domain 1 is not the sole determinant of stop codon recognition in Tetrahymena species. In contrast, the Euplotes hybrid facilitated efficient translation termination at UAA and UAG codons but not at the UGA codon. Together, these results indicate that while domain 1 facilitates stop codon recognition, other factors can influence this process. Our findings also indicate that these two ciliate species used distinct approaches to diverge from the universal genetic code.",https://openalex.org/W16382136,2008,Patrice Buche; Juliette Dibie-Barthélemy; Liliana Ibănescu,
Predicting Gene-Disease Associations with Knowledge Graph Embeddings over Multiple Ontologies,"Ontology-based approaches for predicting gene-disease associations include the more classical semantic similarity methods and more recently knowledge graph embeddings. While semantic similarity is typically restricted to hierarchical relations within the ontology, knowledge graph embeddings consider their full breadth. However, embeddings are produced over a single graph and complex tasks such as gene-disease association may require additional ontologies. We investigate the impact of employing richer semantic representations that are based on more than one ontology, able to represent both genes and diseases and consider multiple kinds of relations within the ontologies. Our experiments demonstrate the value of employing knowledge graph embeddings based on random-walks and highlight the need for a closer integration of different ontologies.",https://openalex.org/W3162347596,2021,Susana Nunes; Rita T.

The goal of this work is to investigate graph partitioning techniques and their application on the modularization of large ontologies, typically, biomedical ontologies. Such investigation may be divided in two steps: (i) how to convert an ontology, represented in OWL or RDF languages into a graph; (ii) which partitioning algorithm would be suitable. More specifically, this work focus is on how to preserve certain ontology properties/relationships in the generated modules. Therefore, a single way of graph conversion was adopted and user-defined edge weights were taken into account. Five graph partitioning algorithms were used for the present investigation, but just three of them were used to verify their behavior in face of edge weight variations. A case study was conducted using a toyontology on the pizza domain, and showed preliminary but interesting results. 1.",https://openalex.org/W2408220509,2012,Ana Carolina Kozlowski Cordeiro Garcia; Letícia Tiveron; Cláudia Marcela Justel,
Ant-based extraction of rules in simple decision systems over ontological graphs,"Abstract In the paper, the problem of extraction of complex decision rules in simple decision systems over ontological graphs is considered. The extracted rules are consistent with the dominance principle similar to that applied in the dominancebased rough set approach (DRSA). In our study, we propose to use a heuristic algorithm, utilizing the ant-based clustering approach, searching the semantic spaces of concepts presented by means of ontological graphs. Concepts included in the semantic spaces are values of attributes describing objects in simple decision systems",https://openalex.org/W1150184784,2015,Krzysztof Pancerz; Arkadiusz Lewicki; Ryszard Tadeusiewicz,University of Management and Administration in Zamosc; University of Information Technology and Management in Rzeszow; AGH University of Krakow
KNIT: Ontology reusability through knowledge graph exploration,"Ontologies have become a standard for knowledge representation across several domains. In Life Sciences, numerous ontologies have been introduced to represent human knowledge, often providing overlapping or conflicting perspectives. These ontologies are usually published as OWL or OBO, and are often registered in open repositories, e.g., BioPortal. However, the task of finding the concepts (classes and their properties) defined in the existing ontologies and the relationships between these concepts across different ontologies – for example, for developing a new ontology aligned with the existing ones – requires a great deal of manual effort in searching through the public repositories for candidate ontologies and their entities. In this work, we develop a new tool, KNIT, to automatically explore open repositories to help users fetch the previously designed concepts using keywords. User-specified keywords are then used to retrieve matching names of classes or properties. KNIT then creates a draft knowledge graph populated with the concepts and relationships retrieved from the existing ontologies. Furthermore, following the process of ontology learning, our tool refines this first draft of an ontology. We present three BioPortal-specific use cases for our tool. These use cases outline the development of new knowledge graphs and ontologies in the sub-domains of biology: genes and diseases, virome and drugs.",https://openalex.org/W4375851120,2023,Jorge Rodríguez-Revello; Cristóbal Barba-González; Maciej Rybiński,Universidad de Málaga; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation; Data61
An Ontology-Based Framework for Geospatial Integration and Querying of Raster Data Cube Using Virtual Knowledge Graphs,"The integration of the raster data cube alongside another form of geospatial data (e.g., vector data) raises considerable challenges when it comes to managing and representing it using knowledge graphs. Such integration can play an invaluable role in handling the heterogeneity of geospatial data and linking the raster data cube to semantic technology standards. Many recent approaches have been attempted to address this issue, but they often lack robust formal elaboration or solely concentrate on integrating raster data cubes without considering the inclusion of semantic spatial entities along with their spatial relationships. This may constitute a major shortcoming when it comes to performing advanced geospatial queries and semantically enriching geospatial models. In this paper, we propose a framework that can enable such semantic integration and advanced querying of raster data cubes based on the virtual knowledge graph (VKG) paradigm. This framework defines a semantic representation model for raster data cubes that extends the GeoSPARQL ontology. With such a model, we can combine the semantics of raster data cubes with features-based models that involve geometries as well as spatial and topological relationships. This could allow us to formulate spatiotemporal queries using SPARQL in a natural way by using ontological concepts at an appropriate level of abstraction. We propose an implementation of the proposed framework based on a VKG system architecture. In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation to compare our framework with other existing systems in terms of performance and scalability. Finally, we show the potential and the limitations of our implementation and we discuss several possible future works.",https://openalex.org/W4386541473,2023,Younes Hamdani; Guohui Xiao; Linfang Ding,Umeå University; University of Bergen; University of Oslo
An Ontology-Based Dynamic Attack Graph Generation Approach for the Internet of Vehicles,"With the development of automobile intelligence, the security of the Internet of Vehicles has become a key factor that affects the development of intelligent vehicles. However, existing security risk analysis methods for the IoV either focus only on certain levels, such as the component level, or perform only a static analysis. This paper proposes a dynamic attack graph generation method for the IoV to identify and visually display the security risks caused by the associated vulnerabilities in an IoV system. First, using the actual architecture of the IoV, this paper shows how to model the security elements and their relationships in the IoV system and proposes a network security ontology model for this system. Second, it shows how to construct a reasoning rule base according to the causal relationship between the vulnerabilities using the Semantic Web Rule Language Finally, in view of the rapid change in the network topology of the IoV, a dynamic attack graph generation algorithm based on an ontology reasoning engine is proposed, which can effectively reduce the overhead caused by the changes in the attack graph. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through an actual security event scenario and a constructed scenario. The experimental results show that the algorithm can dynamically and accurately display the network attack graph of the IoV. The proposed method is helpful in globally analyzing the threat caused by the combined exploitation of the vulnerabilities in an IoV system and risk management.",https://openalex.org/W4282984264,2022,Shuning Hou; Xiuzhen Chen; Jin Ma,Shanghai Jiao Tong University
Semantic relationships and approximations of sets: An ontological graph based approach,"Approximation of sets is a fundamental notion of rough set theory (RST) proposed by Z. Pawlak. In a classic approach, considered in RST, approximation of sets is defined on the basis of an indiscernibility relation between objects in some universe of discourse. However, approximations of sets become problematic in many cases, especially, if attribute values describing objects are symbolical (e.g., words, terms, linguistic concepts, etc.). In fact, such a situation is natural in human cognition and description of the real world. Different approaches perfecting rough set theory in this area have been proposed in the literature. One of them is based on incorporating ontologies enabling us to add some new, valuable knowledge which can be used in data analysis, rule generation, reasoning, etc. In the paper, we propose to use ontological graphs in determining approximations of sets and show how ontological graphs change a look at them. The presented approach refers to a general trend in computations proposed by L. Zadeh and called ""computing with words"".",https://openalex.org/W2035993575,2013,Krzysztof Pancerz,University of Management and Administration in Zamosc
ProGOMap: Automatic Generation of Mappings From Property Graphs to Ontologies,"Property Graph databases (PGs) are emerging as efficient graph stores with flexible schemata. This raises the need to have a unified view over heterogenous data produced from these stores. Ontology based Data Access (OBDA) has become the most dominant approach to integrate heterogeneous data sources by providing a unified conceptual view (ontology) over them. The corner stone of any OBDA system is to define mappings between the data source and the target (domain) ontology. However, manual mapping generation is time consuming and requires great efforts. This paper proposes ProGOMap (<bold>Pro</bold>perty <bold>G</bold>raph to <bold>O</bold>ntology <bold>M</bold>apper) system that automatically generates mappings from property graphs to a domain ontology. ProGOMap starts by generating a putative ontology with direct axioms from PG. A novel ontology learning algorithm is proposed to enrich the putative ontology with subclass axioms inferred from PG. The putative ontology is then aligned to an existing domain ontology using string similarity metrics. Another algorithm is proposed to align object properties between the two ontologies considering different modelling criteria. Finally, mappings are generated from alignment results. Experiments were done on eight data sets with different scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of the generated mappings. The experimental results achieved mapping accuracy up to 97&#x0025; and 81&#x0025; when addressing PG-to-ontology terminological and structural heterogeneities, respectively. Ontology learning by inferring subclass axioms from a property graph helps to address the heterogeneity between the PG and ontology models.",https://openalex.org/W3195838747,2021,Naglaa Fathy; Walaa Gad; Nagwa L.

An Ontological Graph Identification Method for Improving Localization of IP Prefix Hijacking in Network Systems,"IP prefix hijacking continues to be a pervasive cyber security threat to the core internet routing infrastructure. The data security of multiple cloud-based services is also susceptible to these threats, due to the high dependency on traditional routing protocols. Although a number of hijacking detection techniques have been recently proposed, no existing system has effectively addressed the problem of detecting malicious transit Autonomous System (AS) services in any detected hijacking occurrences. The ability to locate and isolate malicious services is critical for conducting a necessary mitigation strategy at an early stage, to minimise the impact of the attack, to restore cloud services quickly. In this paper, we propose an effective real-time processing method, so-called Ontological Graph Identification (OGI), for detecting IP prefix hijacking of nodes and suspicious transit nodes caused by the hijacked nodes through ASs. The proposed method is evaluated using the two public datasets of RIPE RIS and RouteView. Experimental results revealed improved performance for the detection of malicious transit nodes compared with peer techniques. It is, therefore, shown that the proposed method has utility in automating the process of investigating nodes with suspicious activities in real network systems.",https://openalex.org/W2970669891,2019,Osama Alkadi; Nour Moustafa; Benjamin Turnbull,UNSW Sydney; University of Canberra
A Graph-Based Approach for Classifying OWL 2 QL Ontologies.,"Ontology classification is the reasoning service that computes all subsumption relationships inferred in an ontology between concept, role, and attribute names in the ontology signature. OWL 2 QL is a tractable profile of OWL 2 for which ontology classification is polynomial in the size of the ontology TBox. However, to date, no efficient methods and implementations specifically tailored to OWL 2 QL ontologies have been developed. In this paper, we provide a new algorithm for ontology classication in OWL 2 QL, which is based on the idea of encoding the ontology TBox into a directed graph and reducing core reasoning to computation of the transitive closure of the graph. We have implemented the algorithm in the QuOnto reasoner and extensively evaluated it over very large ontologies. Our experiments show that QuOnto outperforms various popular reasoners in classification of OWL 2 QL ontologies.",https://openalex.org/W2406446095,2013,Domenico Lembo; Valerio Santarelli; Domenico Fabio Savo,Sapienza University of Rome
Decolonizing posthumanist geographies,"This paper engages my struggles to craft geo-graphs or earth writings that also further broaden political goals of decolonizing the discipline of geography. To this end, I address a body of literature roughly termed ‘posthumanism’ because it offers powerful tools to identify and critique dualist constructions of nature and culture that work to uphold Eurocentric knowledge and the colonial present. However, I am discomforted by the ways in which geographical engagements with posthumanism tend to reproduce colonial ways of knowing and being by enacting universalizing claims and, consequently, further subordinating other ontologies. Building from this discomfort, I elaborate a critique of geographical-posthumanist engagements. Taking direction from Indigenous and decolonial theorizing, the paper identifies two Eurocentric performances common in posthumanist geographies and analyzes their implications. I then conclude with some thoughts about steps to decolonize geo-graphs. To this end, I take up learnings offered by the Zapatistas. My goal is to foster geographical engagements open to conversing with and walking alongside other epistemic worlds.",https://openalex.org/W1966518066,2013,Juanita Sundberg,University of British Columbia
Computational Modelling for Bankruptcy Prediction: Semantic Data Analysis Integrating Graph Database and Financial Ontology,"In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent methodology to construct a Bankruptcy Prediction Computation Model, which is aimed to execute a company's financial status analysis accurately. Based on the semantic data analysis and management, our methodology considers Semantic Database System as the core of the system. It comprises three layers: an Ontology of Bankruptcy Prediction, Semantic Search Engine, and a Semantic Analysis Graph Database system.\n\nThe Ontological layer defines the basic concepts of the financial risk management as well as the objects that serve as sources of knowledge for predicting a company's bankruptcy. The Graph Database layer utilises a powerful semantic data technology, which serves as a semantic data repository for our model.\n\nThe article provides a detailed description of the construction of the Ontology and its informal conceptual representation. We also present a working prototype of the Graph Database system, constructed using the Neo4j application, and show the connection between well-known financial ratios.\n\nWe argue that this methodology which utilises state of the art semantic data management mechanisms enables data processing and relevant computations in a more efficient way than approaches using the traditional relational database. These give us solid grounds to build a system that is capable of tackling the data of any complexity level.",https://openalex.org/W2963969269,2019,Natalia Yerashenia; Alexander Bolotov,University of Westminster
Ontology Graph Based Query Expansion for Biomedical Information Retrieval,"Query expansion based biomedical information retrieval has been studied for over two decades; most of the studies focus only on taking advantage of one vocabulary: MeSH. We propose a completely different approach utilizing an arbitrary number of controlled vocabularies from Metathesaurus. Experiment shows that our ontology based query expansion scheme achieves 8.2% and 17.7% improvement compared with schemes using pseudo relevance feedback query expansion and using no query expansion respectively. The average improvement is 24.8% in comparison to all other existing strategies. Furthermore, we identify that generalized biomedical concepts are the reason for performance degradation.",https://openalex.org/W2031105697,2011,Liang Dong; Pradip K. Srimani; James Z.

Mapping Relational Databases into Ontologies through a Graph-based Formal Model,"One of key issues of the Semantic Web applications is the lack of semantic data (ontologies). Although the vast majority of data are stored in the popular relational databases, they are still not easily available for many next generation Web applications. Therefore, one of core challenges of Semantic Web is whether these applications can automatically retrieve semantic information from the existed relational databases. This paper proposes a middle graph-based formal model language, W-graph, a bridge between relational databases and ontologies, which abstracts semantic information from relational database instances semi-automatically and then generates an OWL ontology automatically. This method not only maps relational database schemata to ontologies, but also populates ontologies with data stored in databases. Moreover, a proof of semantic preserving on the mapping is provided, and a case study and an implemented prototype tool are also reported.",https://openalex.org/W2108582753,2010,Shihan Yang; Jinzhan Wu,National Science Library; Beijing Jiaotong University; Guangxi University for Nationalities
Construction of Substation Engineering Design Knowledge Graph Based on “Ontology Seven-step Method”,"A great deal of substation engineering projects data and knowledge has been accumulated in the field of electric power survey and design. However, the lack of knowledge mining methods hinders its value creation. The knowledge management in the field hence needs a new mode. Knowledge graph has been widely adopted in some vertical industries recently. Since its schema-less nature, the knowledge graph could be constructed flexibly. It describes the complex relations between entities and concepts in the objective world. This study proposes the construction of substation engineering design domain knowledge graph. Ontology construction in this study is based on ""ontology seven-step method"" and in a top-down approach. Thematic clustering is considered to guide to construct ontology hierarchy manually. Concepts of substation engineering design are stored in the ontology layer, and entities from engineering projects information are in the instance layer. In this way, the structured knowledge can accelerate knowledge retrieving and assist in decision-making. Moreover, the tacit knowledge inferring can also promote knowledge innovation.",https://openalex.org/W3192885426,2021,Wei Jiang; Yali Wang; Junhui Hu,China Power Engineering Consulting Group (China)
"More Knowledge, Less Bias: Unbiasing Scene Graph Generation with Explicit Ontological Adjustment","Scene graph generation (SGG) models seek to detect relationships between objects in a given image. One challenge in this area is the biased distribution of predicates in the dataset and the semantic space. Recent works incorporating knowledge graphs with scene graphs prove effective in improving recall for the tail predicate classes. Moreover, many recent SGG approaches with promising results explicitly redistribute the predicates in both the training process and in the prediction step. To incorporate external knowledge, we construct a commonsense knowledge graph by integrating ConceptNet and Wikidata. To explicitly unbias SGG with knowledge in the reasoning process, we propose a novel framework, Explicit Ontological Adjustment (EOA), to adjust the graph model predictions with knowledge priors. We use the edge matrix from the commonsense knowledge graph as a module in the graph neural network model to refine the relationship detection process. This module proves effective in alleviating the long-tail distribution of predicates. When combined, we show that these modules achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Visual Genome dataset in most cases.

Ontology Instance Linking: Towards Interlinked Knowledge Graphs,"Due to the decentralized nature of the Semantic Web, the same real-world entity may be described in various data sources with different ontologies and assigned syntactically distinct identifiers. In order to facilitate data utilization and consumption in the Semantic Web, without compromising the freedom of people to publish their data, one critical problem is to appropriately interlink such heterogeneous data. This interlinking process is sometimes referred to as Entity Coreference, i.e., finding which identifiers refer to the same real-world entity. In this paper, we first summarize state-of-the-art algorithms in detecting such coreference relationships between ontology instances. We then discuss various techniques in scaling entity coreference to large-scale datasets. Finally, we present well-adopted evaluation datasets and metrics, and compare the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms on such datasets.",https://openalex.org/W2564027179,2016,Jeff Heflin; Dezhao Song,Lehigh University; Thomson Reuters (Canada)
A new method to measure the semantic similarity of GO terms,"Abstract Motivation: Although controlled biochemical or biological vocabularies, such as Gene Ontology (GO) (http://www.geneontology.org), address the need for consistent descriptions of genes in different data sources, there is still no effective method to determine the functional similarities of genes based on gene annotation information from heterogeneous data sources. Results: To address this critical need, we proposed a novel method to encode a GO term's semantics (biological meanings) into a numeric value by aggregating the semantic contributions of their ancestor terms (including this specific term) in the GO graph and, in turn, designed an algorithm to measure the semantic similarity of GO terms. Based on the semantic similarities of GO terms used for gene annotation, we designed a new algorithm to measure the functional similarity of genes. The results of using our algorithm to measure the functional similarities of genes in pathways retrieved from the saccharomyces genome database (SGD), and the outcomes of clustering these genes based on the similarity values obtained by our algorithm are shown to be consistent with human perspectives. Furthermore, we developed a set of online tools for gene similarity measurement and knowledge discovery.

GRAM,"Deep learning methods exhibit promising performance for predictive modeling in healthcare, but two important challenges remain: <i>Data insufficiency:</i> Often in healthcare predictive modeling, the sample size is insufficient for deep learning methods to achieve satisfactory results.<i>Interpretation:</i> The representations learned by deep learning methods should align with medical knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose GRaph-based Attention Model (GRAM) that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical information inherent to medical ontologies. Based on the data volume and the ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. We compared predictive performance (<i>i.e.</i> accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task. Compared to the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely observed in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data. Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level concepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts.",https://openalex.org/W2557074642,2017,Edward Choi; Mohammad Taha Bahadori; Le Song,Georgia Institute of Technology
