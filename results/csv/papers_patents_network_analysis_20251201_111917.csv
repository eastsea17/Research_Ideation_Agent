Technology convergence capability and firm innovation in the manufacturing sector: an approach based on patent network analysis,"As a consequence of the convergence between manufacturing technology and the foundation technologies of Industry 4.0, it is becoming more important for firms to formulate an innovation strategy for their technological capabilities. In this context, the present study measures firm‐level technology convergence (TC) capability using patent network analysis. A firm’s TC capabilities are measured using three centrality indices pertaining to a patent network, which is constructed based on the relationship between patents and their international patent classification. For the empirical analysis, panel regression is conducted to observe the effect of TC capabilities on innovation for the top 30 firms in four manufacturing industries. We find that the TC degree positively influences the firms’ overall innovation, namely their total number of patents, and negatively influences their convergent innovation, calculated as the ratio between the number of TC patents and the total number of patents, while the effect of TC betweenness is the opposite. These findings imply that while concentrating on similar technologies may promote quick technology application, it could hamper the enhancement of a TC’s potential. To promote TC, a firm should thus develop technologies more likely to be involved in TC.",https://openalex.org/W2901355640,2018,Keungoui Kim; Sungdo Jung; Junseok Hwang,Seoul National University; Korea Engineering Consultants Corporation
Hybrid-patent classification based on patent-network analysis,"Effective patent management is essential for organizations to maintain their competitive advantage. The classification of patents is a critical part of patent management and industrial analysis. This study proposes a hybrid-patent-classification approach that combines a novel patent-network-based classification method with three conventional classification methods to analyze query patents and predict their classes. The novel patent network contains various types of nodes that represent different features extracted from patent documents. The nodes are connected based on the relationship metrics derived from the patent metadata. The proposed classification method predicts a query patent's class by analyzing all reachable nodes in the patent network and calculating their relevance to the query patent. It then classifies the query patent with a modified k-nearest neighbor classifier. To further improve the approach, we combine it with content-based, citation-based, and metadata-based classification methods to develop a hybrid-classification approach. We evaluate the performance of the hybrid approach on a test dataset of patent documents obtained from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and compare its performance with that of the three conventional methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed patent-network-based approach yields more accurate class predictions than the patent network-based approach.",https://openalex.org/W2078368867,2010,Duen‐Ren Liu; Meng-Jung Shih,National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University
Patent Network Analysis and Quadratic Assignment Procedures to Identify the Convergence of Robot Technologies,"Because of the remarkable developments in robotics in recent years, technological convergence has been active in this area. We focused on finding patterns of convergence within robot technology using network analysis of patents in both the USPTO and KIPO. To identify the variables that affect convergence, we used quadratic assignment procedures (QAP). From our analysis, we observed the patent network ecology related to convergence and found technologies that have great potential to converge with other robotics technologies. The results of our study are expected to contribute to setting up convergence based R&amp;D policies for robotics, which can lead new innovation.",https://openalex.org/W2529703283,2016,Woojin Lee; Won Kyung Lee; So Young Sohn,Yonsei University
Exploring landscapes of quantum technology with Patent Network Analysis,"While the new chapter of quantum technologies is bringing transformative changes to our society, a quantum ecosystem, which synergises the supportive activities from both social and scientific & technological sides, is acknowledged as a critical force to push the movements. Despite the importance of a quantum ecosystem, current articles barely illustrated its interconnected relations, essential elements and the long-term attributes of developing technologies. We apply the innovation ecosystem and social-technical system theories to bridge such research gaps by realising the patent network analysis. The analytical contents include focal actors, main technological clusters and technological trajectory, and most of them correspond to relevant reports. Particularly, quantum computation is an eye-catching subfield due to its high and intensive knowledge engagements in the past years. Last, we conclude the analytical results and provide two discussions in the discussion & conclusion section as the main contributions. One is to illustrate the long-term attributes and backgrounds of the analytical contents through the lens of the multi-level perspective framework. The other illustrates a path toward a focal actor.",https://openalex.org/W3165404661,2021,Syuan-Yi Jiang; Shin-Liang Chen,Technische Universität Berlin; Freie Universität Berlin; National Cheng Kung University
Multiple patent network analysis for identifying safety technology convergence,"Purpose Using the large database of patent, the purpose of this paper is to structure a technology convergence network using various patent network analysis for integrating different results according to network characteristics. Design/methodology/approach The patent co-class analysis and the patent citation analysis are applied to discover core safety fields and technology, respectively. In specific, three types of network analysis, which are centrality analysis, association rule mining analysis and brokerage network analysis, are applied to measure the individual, synergy and group intensity. Findings The core safety fields derived from three types of network analysis used by different nature of data algorithms are compared with each other to understand distinctive meaning of cores of patent class such as medical safety, working safety and vehicle safety, differentiating network structure. Also, to be specific, the authors find the detailed technology contained in the core patent class using patent citation network analysis. Practical implications The results provide meaningful implications to various stakeholders in organization: safety management, safety engineering and safety policy. The multiple patent network enables safety manager to identify core safety convergence fields and safety engineers to develop new safety technology. Also, in the view of technology convergence, the strategy of safety policy can be expanded to collaboration and open innovation. Originality/value This is the initial study on applying various network analysis algorithms based on patent data (class and citation) for safety management. Through comparison among network analysis techniques, the different results are identified and the collective decision making on finding core of safety technology convergence is supported. The decision maker can obtain the various perspectives of tracing technology convergence.",https://openalex.org/W2950244483,2019,Jeonghwan Jeon; Yongyoon Suh,Gyeongsang National University; Pukyong National University
Patent Classification Using Ontology-Based Patent Network Analysis,"Patent management is increasingly important for organizations to sustain their competitive advantage. The classification of patents is essential for patent management and industrial analysis. In this study, we propose a novel patent network-based classification method to analyze query patents and predict their classes. The proposed patent network, which contains various types of nodes that represent different features extracted from patent documents, is constructed based on the relationship metrics derived from patent metadata. The novel approach analyzes reachable nodes in the patent ontology network to calculate their relevance to query patents, after which it uses the modified k-nearest neighbor classifier to classify query patents. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a test dataset of patent documents obtained from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and compare it with the performance of the three conventional methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed patent network-based approach outperforms the conventional approaches.",https://openalex.org/W93327894,2010,Meng Jung Shih; Duen‐Ren Liu,National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University
Constructing an Intelligent Patent Network Analysis Method,"Patent network analysis, an advanced method of patent analysis, is a useful tool for technology management. This method visually displays all the relationships among the patents and enables the analysts to intuitively comprehend the overview of a set of patents in the field of the technology being studied. Although patent network analysis possesses relative advantages different from traditional methods of patent analysis, it is subject to several crucial limitations. To overcome the drawbacks of the current method, this study proposes a novel patent analysis method, called the intelligent patent network analysis method, to make a visual network with great precision. Based on artificial intelligence techniques, the proposed method provides an automated procedure for searching patent documents, extracting patent keywords, and determining the weight of each patent keyword in order to generate a sophisticated visualization of the patent network. This study proposes a detailed procedure for generating an intelligent patent network that is helpful for improving the efficiency and quality of patent analysis. Furthermore, patents in the field of Carbon Nanotube Backlight Unit (CNT-BLU) were analyzed to verify the utility of the proposed method.",https://openalex.org/W2029646946,2012,Chao-Chan Wu; Ching-Bang Yao,Feng Chia University; Chinese Culture University; National Taiwan University of Science and Technology
Patent network analysis in agriculture: a case study of the development and protection of biotechnologies,"Plant biotechnology has consolidated itself as a radical agricultural innovation, boosting the patenting activities of universities, biotechnology firms, and seed &amp; agrochemicals corporations. We use patent citations networks to study the appropriability efforts that affected the emergence and dynamics of the technological trajectories (TTs) of the genetically modified organisms. Our methodological contribution consists of combining new procedures to identify TTs with the study of the characteristics of scale-free networks. This paper also proposes legal enforcement indicators that attempt to assess the economic importance of patents that make up citation networks. We identify two TTs that include patents on biotech traits and enabling technologies. These patents were both effective in collecting royalties from farmers and deterring potential entrants, particularly through intellectual property (IP) litigation. The results also show that these litigated patents have impacted merger and acquisition activity in seed industry. We conclude that IP lawsuits may have contributed to delaying the R&amp;D investments of new entrants, thus preserving the monopolistic position enjoyed by the pioneering company and restricting the scope of crop innovations.",https://openalex.org/W2985283847,2019,Vinícius Eduardo Ferrari; José Maria Ferreira Jardim da Silveira; Maria Ester Soares Dal Poz,Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Campinas; Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP)
PATENT NETWORK ANALYSIS OF CLOUD COMPUTING BY TEXT MINING,"With the rise of cloud computing technology, many IT manufacturers have rushed to enter the market. However, to date, only a few attempts have been made at the patent analysis of cloud computing. The main contribution of this research is to propose a two-stage retrieval strategy and a systematic method for conducting patent network analysis on cloud computing. By conducting bibliometric and network analyses, we show that a two-stage patent retrieval method can successfully identify patents belonging to cloud computing. The effectiveness of the proposed systematic method for patent network analysis is proved through gray relational-based cluster analysis. With the aid of visual networks and technology centrality indexes, this study seeks to reveal the overall patent structure and identify the key technologies of cloud computing. The results of this study can provide a valuable reference for enterprises intending to enter the cloud computing industry.",https://openalex.org/W2522353537,2016,Jia‐Yen Huang,
The spatiotemporal evolution of global innovation networks and the changing position of China: a social network analysis based on cooperative patents,"This study uses global patent cooperation data from 1999 to 2020, employs social network analysis, and explores the changes in and driving forces of global innovation networks (GINs) in the past 20 years as well as the change in China's position in the global innovation system. The results show that on the whole, the network accessibility of GINs has continuously improved, showing scale‐free network characteristics. The important nodes in the network are mainly developed countries such as Europe and the United States, and the node polarization effect has weakened; the network has four agglomeration subgroups. The phenomenon of subgroups and factions is not obvious. Further factor identification shows that economic factors and technological information factors have the strongest correlation with the innovation network and that demographic factors have a weaker correlation with the innovation network. In addition, China's position in the innovation network has been increasing year by year, and the role of ‘transit stations’ has become increasingly prominent.",https://openalex.org/W4388991080,2023,Feng Hu; Liping Qiu; Shaobin Wei,North Minzu University; Zhejiang Gongshang University; Ningbo University
Technology Fusion Characteristics in the Solar Photovoltaic Industry of South Korea: A Patent Network Analysis Using IPC Co-Occurrence,"This study analyzes the technology fusion phenomena and its characteristics, focusing on the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry in South Korea. Co-occurrence networks of international patent classification (IPC) codes have been analyzed based on the photovoltaic patents in South Korea during a 15-year period (2002–2016). The results reveal that, while the strength of technology fusion has greatly increased during the period, the structural pattern of fusion has been diversified or decentralized. In the early stage, widespread emergence of new technologies has been observed but, in the later stage, the focus of fusion shifted to the utilization of existing technologies. The characteristics of key technologies also changed as the technology fusion progressed. In the early stage, product technologies such as materials and components played a central role, while operation technologies such as monitor, structure, and arrangement were the drivers of fusion during the later stage.",https://openalex.org/W3096502709,2020,Sungho Son; Nam-Wook Cho,Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute; Seoul National University; Seoul National University of Science and Technology
A methodology to position nations’ efforts in a technology domain with a patent network analysis: case of the electric vehicle domain,"When a nation is making strategies in a technology domain, it makes sense to know where the nation is currently in the domain and to know where other nations are as well. This paper presents a method to position nations’ efforts in a technology domain. The method builds a network of International Patent Classifications (IPCs) based on their co-occurrence in patent applications and applies an index called the Revealed Patent Application Advantage (RPAA), which reflects where nations’ efforts have been spent in a technology domain denoted as the IPC network. We applied the proposed method to position the efforts that have been spent in the electric vehicle (EV) technology domain by mainland China, Germany, Japan, and the United States.",https://openalex.org/W2791502704,2018,Feng Shen; Tieju Ma,East China University of Science and Technology; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
Localization of Knowledge and the Mobility of Engineers in Regional Networks,"Knowledge, once generated, spills only imperfectly among firms and nations. We posit that since institutions and labor networks vary by region, there should be regional variations in the localization of spillovers. We investigate the relationship between the mobility of major patent holders and the localization of technological knowledge through the analysis of patent citations of important semiconductor innovations. We find that knowledge localization is specific to only certain regions (particularly Silicon Valley) and that the degree of localization varies across regions. By analyzing data on the interfirm mobility of patent holders, we empirically show that the interfirm mobility of engineers influences the local transfer of knowledge. The flow of knowledge is embedded in regional labor networks.",https://openalex.org/W2143585157,1999,Paul Almeida; Bruce Kogut,Georgetown University; University of Pennsylvania

Patent Network Analysis for Identifying Technological Evolution: A Case Study of China's Artificial Intelligence Technologies,"Identifying technological evolution is a crucial way to assist in technology management. Since modern technology has become more and more complex and dynamic, general statistical techniques can hardly capture the underlying information of technological interconnection in the process of technology evolution. However, complex network analysis can be considered to be a powerful tool to investigate this issue. At the same time, patent documents containing rich information to indicate technological evolution in sequential time period can be a significant data source. This paper, based on the core terms derived from patent documents, constructs technological networks, to present the distribution of technologies. The comparison between the networks in sequential time periods can not only provide a way to understand technological evolution in detail, but also forecast technology opportunities, which can be used to help understand the development of selected technologies quickly and provide insights to research and development (R&D) plan and technological commercialization. A case study on exploring the evolution of China's artificial intelligence technologies is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of this method.",https://openalex.org/W2773897728,2017,Lu Huang; Miao Wen; Yi Zhang,Beijing Institute of Technology; Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology
Patented Network Analysis on Cloud Computing Technology in Internet of Things,"Internet of Things (IOT) is considered as the world's third wave of the information industry after the inventions of computer and Internet. Cloud computing is among the key technologies in the scope of IOT. In this paper, we choose related patents of cloud computing technology between 1963-2014 from the Derwent Innovations Index database. We extract research technology-related patents of cloud computing, comprehensive utilization of patented metrology research methods and analysis of complex networks. Results show that China has a small number of R&D personnel, and there is no breakdown of the unique and leading technology, while the U.S. Companies have relatively strong R&D capabilities. It indicates us to reduce the gap between China and the U.S. In the development of cloud computing technology.

Data-Driven Platform Design: Patent Data and Function Network Analysis,"A properly designed product-system platform seeks to reduce the cost and lead time for design and development of the product-system family. A key goal is to achieve a tradeoff between economy of scope from product variety and economy of scale from platform sharing. Traditionally, product platform planning uses heuristic and manual approaches and relies almost solely on expertise and intuition. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to draw the boundary of a platform-system, complementing the other platform design approaches and assisting designers in the architecting process. The method generates a network of functions through relationships of their co-occurrences in prior designs of a product or systems domain and uses a network analysis algorithm to identify an optimal core–periphery structure. Functions identified in the network core co-occur cohesively and frequently with one another in prior designs, and thus, are suggested for inclusion in the potential platform to be shared across a variety of product-systems with peripheral functions. We apply the method to identify the platform functions for the application domain of spherical rolling robots (SRRs), based on patent data.",https://openalex.org/W2903504742,2018,Binyang Song; Jianxi Luo; Kristin L.

The unbalanced dynamics in Sino-South Korea scientific and technological collaboration: a triple helix perspective with insights from paper and patent network analysis,"This study attempts to explore Sino-South Korea collaborations in science and technology, focusing on the networks of university–industry–government (UIG) relations embedded in co-authored papers and co-assigned patents at the institutional and global levels. Patents and scientific publications are examined over the period 2004–2014 to capture recent trends and patterns of collaborative innovation activities among UIG actors in China and South Korea. The analysis has been carried out from a triple helix perspective, investigating the structure and dynamics of the Sino-Korea scientific and technological collaborations. The result reveals an imbalance between science and technology in knowledge dynamics and the different extent and intensity of collaborative efforts of the two countries. Based on comparative analysis of co-authorship and co-inventorship networks, the scale and density of scientific collaboration networks appear much higher than those of the technological counterpart. In fact, the technological collaboration between China and Korea is not common in patents and its network needs to be further strengthened. Implications for both China and Korea of future collaborative relationships are discussed.",https://openalex.org/W2599487334,2017,JungWon Yoon; Han Woo Park,Soongsil University; Yeungnam University
Absorptive capacities and external openness in underdeveloped innovation systems: a patent network analysis for Latin American countries 1970–2017,"Abstract This paper contributes to the literature on innovation and development by analysing the absorptive and connectivity capacities of Latin American innovation systems between 1970 and 2017. Applying network analysis to a USPTO database containing Latin American inventors, we build and analyse collaboration networks in the process of invention and knowledge appropriation. The structural properties and the evolution of such networks allow us to measure critical attributes of the Latin American innovation systems. Specifically, the networks exhibit low absorptive capacity and high external openness, which are critical linkages with external nodes in the network growth process. We identify different trajectories of innovation systems within the region, analysing specific paths of capability (de)accumulation and network maturity against the backdrop of national development trajectories.",https://openalex.org/W4386839643,2023,Carlos Bianchi; Pablo Galaso; Sergio Palomeque,Universidad de Montevideo; Universidad de la República de Uruguay

We used topic modelling based on latent Dirichlet allocation analysis to identify underlying topics in sub-areas in the field. We also used social network analysis to measure the centrality indices of publication keywords to detect important and influential sub-areas and used co-occurrence analysis of keywords to visualise relationships among subfields. The research result is useful to identify evolving topics and areas of current focus in the field of humanoid technology. The results contribute to identify valuable research patterns from publications and to increase understanding of the hidden knowledge themes that are revealed by patents.,https://openalex.org/W2995917056,2019,Richa Kumari; Jae Yun Jeong; Byeong-Hee Lee,Korea University of Science and Technology; Science and Technology Policy Institute; Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information
Angiographic Patency of Coronary Artery Bypass Conduits: A Network Meta‐Analysis of Randomized Trials,"Background Several randomized trials have compared the patency of coronary artery bypass conduits. All of the published studies, however, have performed pairwise comparisons and a comprehensive evaluation of the patency rates of all conduits has yet to be published. We set out to investigate the angiographic patency rates of all conduits used in coronary bypass surgery by performing a network meta‐analysis of the current available randomized evidence. Methods and Results A systematic literature search was conducted for randomized controlled trials comparing the angiographic patency rate of the conventionally harvested saphenous vein, the no‐touch saphenous vein, the radial artery (RA), the right internal thoracic artery, or the gastroepiploic artery. The primary outcome was graft occlusion. A total of 4160 studies were retrieved of which 14 were included with 3651 grafts analyzed. The weighted mean angiographic follow‐up was 5.1 years. Compared with the conventionally harvested saphenous vein, both the RA (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35–0.82) and the no‐touch saphenous vein (IRR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39–0.78) were associated with lower graft occlusion. The RA ranked as the best conduit (rank score for RA 0.87 versus 0.85 for no‐touch saphenous vein, 0.23 for right internal thoracic artery, 0.29 for gastroepiploic artery, and 0.25 for the conventionally harvested saphenous vein). Conclusions Compared with the conventionally harvested saphenous vein, only the RA and no‐touch saphenous vein grafts are associated with significantly lower graft occlusion rates. The RA ranks as the best conduit. Registration URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero ; Unique identifier: CRD42020164492.",https://openalex.org/W3135820989,2021,Mario Gaudino; Irbaz Hameed; N.

Text and Dynamic Network Analysis for Measuring Technological Convergence: A Case Study on Defense Patent Data,"Identifying technology convergence is getting harder, especially in fast-evolving and cross-technological fields. On the other side, natural language processing and network analysis researchers is to provide a novel method for mapping technologies and their relations over time, in order to identify dynamic patterns of convergence and to test it on the C4ISTAR field, a defense-related cross-technological field. The methodology automatically extracts technologies from a corpus of scientific papers, policy documents, websites, and company reports using Named Entity Recognition approaches. These technologies are then retrieved from the second corpus of more than 300 thousand patents related to the C4ISTAR domain, measuring their cooccurrences over time.

Patent citation network analysis: A perspective from descriptive statistics and ERGMs,"Patent Citation Analysis has been gaining considerable traction over the past few decades. In this paper, we collect extensive information on patents and citations and provide a perspective of citation network analysis of patents from a statistical viewpoint. We identify and analyze the most cited patents, the most innovative and the highly cited companies along with the structural properties of the network by providing in-depth descriptive analysis. Furthermore, we employ Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze the citation networks. ERGMs enables understanding the social perspectives of a patent citation network which has not been studied earlier. We demonstrate that social properties such as homophily (the inclination to cite patents from the same country or in the same language) and transitivity (the inclination to cite references’ references) together with the technicalities of the patents ( e.g., language, categories), has a significant effect on citations. We also provide an in-depth analysis of citations for sectors in patents and how it is affected by the size of the same. Overall, our paper delves into European patents with the aim of providing new insights and serves as an account for fitting ERGMs on large networks and analyzing them. ERGMs help us model network mechanisms directly, instead of acting as a proxy for unspecified dependence and relationships among the observations.",https://openalex.org/W3109146160,2020,Manajit Chakraborty; Maksym Byshkin; Fábio Crestani,Università della Svizzera italiana
Investigating the Structure of the Internet of Things Patent Network Using Social Network Analysis,"The Internet of Things (IoT) makes the world around us more intelligent and more responsive by developing cyber–physical systems.

Exploring Technology Influencers from Patent Data Using Association Rule Mining and Social Network Analysis,"A patent is an important document issued by the government to protect inventions or product design. Inventions consist of mechanical structures, production processes, quality improvements of products, and so on. Generally, goods or appliances in everyday life are a result of an invention or product design that has been published in patent documents. A new invention contributes to the standard of living, improves productivity and quality, reduces production costs for industry, or delivers products with higher added value. Patent documents are considered to be excellent sources of knowledge in a particular field of technology, leading to inventions. Technology trend forecasting from patent documents depends on the subjective experience of experts. However, accumulated patent documents consist of a huge amount of text data, making it more difficult for those experts to gain knowledge precisely and promptly. Therefore, technology trend forecasting using objective methods is more feasible. There are many statistical methods applied to patent analysis, for example, technology overview, investment volume, and the technology life cycle. There are also data mining methods by which patent documents can be classified, such as by technical characteristics, to support business decision-making. The main contribution of this study is to apply data mining methods and social network analysis to gain knowledge in emerging technologies and find informative technology trends from patent data. We experimented with our techniques on data retrieved from the European Patent Office (EPO) website. The technique includes K-means clustering, text mining, and association rule mining methods. The patent data analyzed include the International Patent Classification (IPC) code and patent titles. Association rule mining was applied to find associative relationships among patent data, then combined with social network analysis (SNA) to further analyze technology trends. SNA provided metric measurements to explore the most influential technology as well as visualize data in various network layouts. The results showed emerging technology clusters, their meaningful patterns, and a network structure, and suggested information for the development of technologies and inventions.",https://openalex.org/W3036393285,2020,Pranomkorn Ampornphan; Sutep Tongngam,National Institute of Development Administration
"Patent foramen ovale closure, antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation in patients with patent foramen ovale and cryptogenic stroke: a systematic review and network meta-analysis incorporating complementary external evidence","Objective To examine the relative impact of three management options in patients aged &lt;60 years with cryptogenic stroke and a patent foramen ovale (PFO): PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy, antiplatelet therapy alone and anticoagulation alone. Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) supported by complementary external evidence. Data sources Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL. Study selection Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) addressing PFO closure and/or medical therapies in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke. Review methods We conducted an NMA complemented with external evidence and rated certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results Ten RCTs in eight studies proved eligible (n=4416). Seven RCTs (n=3913) addressed PFO closure versus medical therapy. Of these, three (n=1257) addressed PFO closure versus antiplatelet therapy, three (n=2303) addressed PFO closure versus mixed antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies and one (n=353) addressed PFO closure versus anticoagulation. The remaining three RCTs (n=503) addressed anticoagulant versus antiplatelet therapy. PFO closure versus antiplatelet therapy probably results in substantial reduction in ischaemic stroke recurrence (risk difference per 1000 patients over 5 years (RD): −87, 95% credible interval (CrI) −100 to −33; moderate certainty). Compared with anticoagulation, PFO closure may confer little or no difference in ischaemic stroke recurrence (low certainty) but probably has a lower risk of major bleeding (RD −20, 95% CrI −27 to −2, moderate certainty). Relative to either medical therapy, PFO closure probably increases the risk of persistent atrial fibrillation (RD 18, 95% CI +5 to +56, moderate certainty) and device-related adverse events (RD +36, 95% CI +23 to +50, high certainty). Anticoagulation, compared with antiplatelet therapy, may reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke recurrence (RD −71, 95% CrI −100 to +17, low certainty), but probably increases the risk of major bleeding (RD +12, 95% CrI −5 to +65, moderate certainty). Conclusions In patients aged &lt;60 years, PFO closure probably confers an important reduction in ischaemic stroke recurrence compared with antiplatelet therapy alone but may make no difference compared with anticoagulation. PFO closure incurs a risk of persistent atrial fibrillation and device-related adverse events. Compared with alternatives, anticoagulation probably increases major bleeding.

Exploring knowledge flow within a technology domain by conducting a dynamic analysis of a patent co-citation network,"Purpose This paper aims to present a methodology by which future knowledge flow can be predicted by predicting co-citations of patents within a technology domain using a link prediction algorithm applied to a co-citation network. Design/methodology/approach Several methods and approaches are used: a dynamic analysis of a patent citation network to identify technology life cycle phases, patent co-citation network mapping from the patent citation network and the application of link prediction algorithms to the patent co-citation network. Findings The results of the presented study indicate that future knowledge flow within a technology domain can be predicted by predicting patent co-citations using the preferential attachment link prediction algorithm. Furthermore, they indicate that the patent – co-citations occurring between the end of the growth life cycle phase and the start of the maturation life cycle phase contribute the most to the precision of the knowledge flow prediction. Finally, it is demonstrated that most of the predicted knowledge flow occurs in a time period closely following the application of the link – prediction algorithm. Practical implications By having insight into future potential co-citations of patents, a firm can leverage its existing patent portfolio or asses the acquisition value of patents or the companies owning them. Originality/value It is demonstrated that the flow of knowledge in patent co-citation networks follows a rich get richer intuition. Moreover, it is show that the knowledge contained in younger patents has a greater chance of being cited again. Finally, it is demonstrated that these co-citations can be predicted in the short term when the preferential attachment algorithm is applied to a patent co-citation network.",https://openalex.org/W3036238672,2020,Vladimir Smojver; Mario Štorga; Goran Zovak,University of Zagreb; Luleå University of Technology
Exploring landscapes of quantum technology with Patent Network Analysis,"While the new chapter of quantum technologies is bringing transformative changes to our society, a quantum ecosystem, which synergises the supportive activities from both social and scientific & technological sides, is acknowledged as a critical force to push the movements. Despite the importance of a quantum ecosystem, current articles barely illustrated its interconnected relations, essential elements and the long-term attributes of developing technologies. We apply the innovation ecosystem and social-technical system theories to bridge such research gaps by realising the patent network analysis. The analytical contents include focal actors, main technological clusters and technological trajectory, and most of them correspond to relevant reports. Particularly, quantum computation is an eye-catching subfield due to its high and intensive knowledge engagements in the past years. Last, we conclude the analytical results and provide two discussions in the discussion & conclusion section as the main contributions. One is to illustrate the long-term attributes and backgrounds of the analytical contents through the lens of the multi-level perspective framework. The other illustrates a path toward a focal actor.",https://openalex.org/W4400735322,2024,Syuan-Yi Jiang; Shin-Liang Chen,
Research on the Patent Innovation Performance of University–Industry Collaboration Based on Complex Network Analysis,"Purpose: In order to explore the multiplicative interaction between clustering and reach, as well as their effect on members' knowledge production and patent value, the authors researched university–industry collaboration networks in the emerging interdisciplinary field at a corporate level.Methodology: The authors based their research on a platform of nano-biopharmaceuticals complex network analysis. Furthermore, they built a network to analyze the influence of small-world properties, as well as the impact of the largest component on the patent value of innovation activities at a corporate level. In this article, the authors conduct an empirical investigation of university–industry patent innovation collaboration in the nano-biopharmaceutical field and propose that their research be considered as new evidence in addition to the previously published literature in this field. Given the pre-existing high skew of patent values in relation to registered patents, they used weighted patent value in the measurement of university–industry innovation performance, rather than simple patent counts.Results: The results show that small-world structures have a parabolical influence on patent innovation performance at corporate level.Findings: The findings go beyond previous research results and can contribute to policy formulation and relevant entrepreneurial decisions in the establishment of university–industry collaboration.",https://openalex.org/W2014467589,2014,Jiang MingJi; Ping Zhou,Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai University of Finance and Economics; Shanghai University of International Business and Economics
Intelligent patent analysis through the use of a neural network,"The main area of this paper concerns the neural methods for mapping scientific and technical information (articles, patents) and for assisting a user in carrying out the complex process of analysing large quantities of such information.In the procedure of information analysis, like in the domain of patent analysis, the complexity of the studied topics and the accuracy of the question to be answered may often lead the analyst to partition his reasoning into viewpoints. Most of the classical information analysis tools can only manage an analysis of the studied domain in a global way. The information analysis tool that will be considered in our study is the MultiSOM tool whose core model represents a significant extension of the classical Kohonen SOM neural model. The MultiSOM neural-based tool introduces the concepts of viewpoints and dynamics into the information analysis with its multi-maps displays and its inter-map communication process. The dynamic information exchange between maps can be exploited by an analyst in order to perform cooperative deduction between several different analyzes that have been performed on the same data.The paper demonstrates the efficiency of a viewpoint-oriented-analysis as compared to a global analysis in the domain of patents. Both objective and subjective quality criteria are taken into account for quality evaluation.The experimental context of the paper is constituted by a patent database of 1000 patents related to oil engineering. The patents structure and the patents field semantics are firstly exploited in order to generate different viewpoints corresponding to different areas of interest for the analysts. In the experiment the selected viewpoints correspond to uses, advantages, patentees, and titles subfields of the patents. The indexing vocabulary of each viewpoint is automatically extracted of its related textual contents in the patents through a full text analysis. The resulting vocabulary is then used to rebuild patents descriptions regarding each viewpoint. These descriptions are finally classified through the unsupervised MultiSOM algorithm resulting in as much different maps as viewpoints. A fifth ""global viewpoint"" which represent the combination of all the specific ones is also considered in order to perform our comparison between a global classification mechanism and a pure viewpoint-oriented classification mechanism.",https://openalex.org/W2107712274,2003,Jean-Charles Lamirel; Shadi Al Shehabi; Martial Hoffmann,Laboratoire Lorrain de Recherche en Informatique et ses Applications; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique
Structural Evolution and Policy Orientationof China’s Rare Earth Innovation Network:A Social Network Analysis Based onCollaborative Patents,"To clearly describe the structural characteristics of China's rare earth innovation network (REIN), this study used data on China's rare earth patents since 2001 in the Incopat global patent database to analyze the structural characteristics of China's REIN from 2001 to 2020 at the provincial and municipal levels using social network analysis.The study finds the following: (1) The overall characteristics of the network show that the connectivity and diversification of China's REIN is increasing.(2) The network spatial pattern analysis shows that the REIN exhibits a radial spatial pattern centered on Beijing at both the provincial and municipal levels.(3) Research on network nodes shows that the network is dense in eastern regions and sparse in western regions, showing distinct characteristics of coastal and resource agglomeration.Not all regions with high levels of economic development play leading roles in the REIN.Small and medium-sized cities with abundant rare earth resources also play important",https://openalex.org/W4391173616,2024,Feng Hu; Shi Xiao-jiao; Shaobin Wei,Shanghai University of International Business and Economics; Zhejiang Gongshang University; East China Normal University
PATENT COOPERATIVE PATTERNS AND DEVELOPMENT TRENDS OF CHINESE CONSTRUCTION ENTERPRISES: A NETWORK ANALYSIS,"Despite the rapid development of Chinese construction industry, there has been little research effort directed towards exploring patent cooperative patterns and evolution trends of construction enterprises, especially from the perspective of the patent development network. This paper extracts implicit collaborative information and introduces Social Network Analysis (SNA) method to conduct the patentometric analysis based on patent data from the “Top 500 Chinese Construction Enterprises” sourced from PatSnap database. The enterprise-enterprise networks and enterprise-university networks are analyzed quantitatively. The results reveal that: 1) there is a rising trend in the number of patents and patentees; 2) state-owned enterprises play a dominant role in patent development; 3) most of patents are classified as International Patent Classification E04G21; 4) the cooperative relationships are mainly within enterprises and their subsidiaries; 5) when enterprises choose to cooperate with universities, in addition to professional qualification, geographical factors should also be considered. Finally, the development and patent evolution trends are discussed. Some useful suggestions are proposed. The contribution lies in: (a) providing a visualization of the implicit collaboration information of patents in Chinese construction enterprises; (b) revealing cooperative patterns of construction enterprises on patents; and (c) providing enterprises some useful suggestions for patent cooperation.",https://openalex.org/W2922327800,2019,Botao Zhong; Yongjian Hei; Heng Li,Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Hubei Engineering University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University

The Use of Social Network Analysis in Knowledge Diffusion Research from Patent Data,"Patent documents are an ample source of technical and commercial knowledge and, thus, patent analysis has long been considered a useful vehicle for R&D management and technoeconomic analysis. In terms of techniques for patent analysis, citation analysis has been the most frequently adopted tool. In this research, we note that citation analysis is subject to some crucial drawbacks and propose a network-based analysis, an alternative method for citation analysis. By using an illustrative data set, the overall process of developing patent network is described. The main objective is to understand that the knowledge diffuse between institution and countries. The knowledge diffusion networks are described by using critical node, core network, and network measures analysis .This includes identifying key influential players, the knowledge spillover patterns among them, and the overall knowledge spillover efficiency. The proposed framework is applied to the field of liquid crystal display (LCD), including the patent citation networks of assignee and countries. The analysis shows that the Japan is the most important citation center in LCD research and the LG Phillps LCD, Sharp Samsung, Hitachi, IBM, and AUO are central points of knowledge flow.",https://openalex.org/W2159770779,2009,Chao‐Chih Hsueh; Chun-Chieh Wang,Yuanpei University; National Taiwan University
Graph Representation Learning Towards Patents Network Analysis,"Patent analysis has recently been recognized as a powerful technique for large companies in the world to lend them insight into the age of competition among various industries. This technique is considered a shortcut for developing countries since it can significantly accelerate their technology development. Therefore, as an inevitable process, patent analysis can be utilized to monitor rival companies and diverse industries. In this research, a graph representation learning approach employed to create, analyze and find similarities of the patents data registered in the Iranian Official Gazette. The patent records were scrapped and wrangled through the Iranian Official Gazette portal. Afterward, the key entities were extracted from the scrapped patents dataset to create the Iranian patents graph from scratch based on novel natural language processing and entity resolution technique. Finally, thanks to the utilization of novel graph algorithms and text mining methods, we identified new areas of industry and research from Iranian patent data, which can be used extensively to prevent duplicate patents, familiarity with similar and connected inventions, Awareness of legal entities supporting patents and knowledge of researchers and linked stakeholders in a particular research field.",https://openalex.org/W4214841892,2021,Mohammad Heydari; Babak Teimourpour,Tarbiat Modares University
Mobility of skilled workers and co-invention networks: an anatomy of localized knowledge flows,"This article illustrates the contribution of mobile inventors and networks of inventors to&#13;\nthe diffusion of knowledge across firms and within cities or states. It is based upon an&#13;\noriginal data set on US inventors’ patent applications at the European Patent Office,&#13;\nin the fields of drugs, biotechnology and organic chemistry. The study combines the&#13;\nmethodology originally proposed by Jaffe et al. (1993, Quarterly Journal of Economics,&#13;\n108: 577–598) with tools from social network analysis, in order to evaluate extent of&#13;\nthe localization of knowledge flows, as measured by patent citations. After controlling&#13;\nfor inventors’ mobility and for the resulting co-invention network, the residual effect of&#13;\nspatial proximity on knowledge diffusion is found to be greatly reduced. We argue that&#13;\nthe most fundamental reason why geography matters in constraining the diffusion of&#13;\nknowledge is that mobile researchers are not likely to relocate in space, so that their&#13;\nco-invention network is also localized. In the light of these results, we revisit common&#13;\ninterpretations of localized knowledge flows as externalities.",https://openalex.org/W2061990921,2009,Stefano Breschi; Francesco Lissoni,Bocconi University; University of Brescia
Identifying the structure of knowledge networks in the US mobile ecosystems: patent citation analysis,"With the emergence of smartphones, the paradigm of the mobile ecosystem has changed rapidly. In particular, global mobile firms focus on technological competition when jostling for market position in recognition of the strategic need to secure a strong mobile platform. In this paper, we analyse the network structure of technological knowledge flows in mobile ecosystems using US patent citation information. We find that two subsectors, platform providers and application and software providers, are at the centre of knowledge exchange activity and play a brokerage role as the key knowledge mediator. Then, we categorise mobile firms into five different groups based on the patterns of their network centrality: knowledge keystone players, knowledge-distributing mediators, knowledge-absorbing mediators, catch-up players, and pure knowledge receivers. The categorisation of firms demonstrates that knowledge flows in the mobile industry converge towards a few leading firms, and such patterns are shaping the mobile ecosystem with respect to technological knowledge. The firms categorised as catch-up players have played a brokerage role within their group, while the firms categorised as knowledge keystone players play a brokerage role across different groups.",https://openalex.org/W2273933399,2015,Sanghoon Lee; Wonjoon Kim; Hakyeon Lee,Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; Technology Management Economics Society; Seoul National University of Science and Technology
"Open innovation and network dynamics. An analysis of openness of co-patenting collaborations in Florence, Italy","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relational dynamics for innovation and, in particular, the impact of the openness of innovation process on the innovation capacity of organisations in restricted geographical contexts. Design/methodology/approach Through a negative binomial regression, the work analyses how the characteristics of the openness of the organisation’s innovation process in the period 2004-2010 influence the firm’s patent productivity in the following period (2011-2016). Findings The breadth of the open innovation (OI) process, here measured by the number of external network ties that an organisation realises for the realisation of its patents, has a positive effect on patent productivity. The depth of the openness, that is, the intensity of external network ties, has an equally positive influence on the innovative performance. However, after a tipping point, the patent productivity tends to decrease, underlining the costs and problems of OI practices. Research limitations/implications This study considers only patent collaborations in the city of Florence. Therefore, it focusses on codified innovations and on a single territorial case study. Practical implications The results underline the importance of the adoption of OI practices in restricted geographical contexts (such as cities, clusters or industrial districts) but with several limitations. Only collaborating more with others does not foster the organisation’s invention productivity, but different types of evidence are found here. Originality/value An original database has been created, containing all the information on patents realised in the area of Florence from 2004 until 2016, and a social networks analysis was applied to identify the local innovation networks.",https://openalex.org/W3017770666,2020,Francesco Capone; Niccolò Innocenti,University of Florence
Exploration of Technological Collaboration Trends in Ulsan through Patent Network Analysis,"The purpose of this study is to explore the technological cooperation structure of Ulsan through the analysis of the technological cooperation network.This study analyzed the network of patent applicants filed in Ulsan for 10 years from 2012 to 2021.The study conducted frequency analysis of patent networks to identify major applicants and key technology in Ulsan.The result showed patent applications have been rapidly expanding to universities and individuals, which increases the diversity of industries and technologies in the region.Especially, the study investigated co-occurrence patterns of patent applicants over time to examine collaboration trends in Ulsan.The result showed Collaborative Activities of Industry-University-Research have not yet been extensively expanded.Moreover, there is a tendency to collaborate with applicants outside the region rather than within the region.However, the local environment for technical cooperation has improved, and small-scale cooperation has recently been on the rise.In particular, local universities are not only the core of knowledge production and distribution, but also central to cooperative activities for the effective production and distribution of knowledge.",https://openalex.org/W4367316973,2023,Hye Kyeong Kim; Il Young Choi,Kyung Hee University
Biorefinery and sustainability for the production of biofuels and value-added products: A trends analysis based on network and patent analysis,"Biorefineries are modern mechanisms used for producing value-added products and biofuels from different biomass sources. However, a crucial challenge is to achieve a sustainable model for their adequate implementation. Challenges related to technical efficiency and economic feasibility are two of the most relevant problems. Therefore, the present study sought to determine the current trends in basic research and technological development around biorefining and sustainability. We carried out a co-occurrence analysis and a patent analysis using data obtained from the Scopus and Lens databases to provide a general overview of the current state of this area of knowledge. The co-occurrence analysis intends to provide an overview of biorefining and sustainability based on terms associated with these two concepts as a starting point to determine the progress and existing challenges of the field. The results of the patent analysis consisted in identifying the main technological sectors, applicants, and territories where inventions associated with biorefining are registered. The analysis of the information showed that bioeconomy, techno-economic aspects, circular economy, technical issues associated with biomass production, and biofuels represent the focal point of basic research in a wide range of disciplines. Technology development is focused on fermentation, enzymes, and microorganisms, among other areas, which shows the validity of these traditional techniques in addressing the problems faced by the bioeconomy. This scenario shows that developed economies are the driving force behind this area of knowledge and that the PCT system is fundamental for the protection and commercialization of these inventions in places different from where they originated. Furthermore, the challenge lies in learning to work in alternative and complementary technological sectors, beyond microbiology and enzyme applications, in pursuit of the sector’s technical and economic feasibility.",https://openalex.org/W4315754585,2023,Alejandro Barragán-Ocaña; Humberto Merritt; Omar Eduardo Sánchez-Estrada,Instituto Politécnico Nacional; Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México; Universidad del Valle de México
How do new use environments influence a technology's knowledge trajectory? A patent citation network analysis of lithium-ion battery technology,"It is important for policymakers and industry practitioners to understand the factors that influence the evolution of a technology’s knowledge base, i.e., its knowledge trajectory. The literature on the evolution of technologies and their underlying knowledge bases suggests that technological innovation takes place in an incremental and cumulative manner along certain trajectories. We extend this literature by not only focusing on the influence of the design hierarchy on the evolution of knowledge, but also the influence of emergence of use environments. We focus on the case of lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology from 1970 to 2018. We use a dataset of 101,620 patent families to identify and analyze the LIB industry’s core knowledge trajectory. Our results indicate that the emergence of new use environments (in particular, those that require different service characteristics as compared to older use environments) can serve as an important mechanism for increased knowledge generation at the level of the product architecture, increased product innovation, increased technological uncertainty, and increased participation of new actors in the core knowledge trajectory. We discuss implications for practitioners and policy makers interested in understanding factors that influence the relative knowledge positions of firms and nations in complex, multi-purpose technologies.",https://openalex.org/W3179520015,2021,Abhishek Malhotra; Huiting Zhang; Martin Beuse,ETH Zurich; Indian Institute of Technology Delhi

Effectiveness and safety of treatments used for the management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis,"Introduction Management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants is one of the most controversial topics in neonatal medicine. The availability of different pharmacotherapeutic options often poses a practical challenge to the practising neonatologist as to which one to choose as a therapeutic option. Our objectives are to determine the relative merits of the available pharmacotherapeutic options for the management of PDA. Methods and Analysis We will conduct a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials evaluating the use of intravenous or oral: indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen for the treatment of PDA in preterm infants. The primary outcome is failure of closure of the PDA. Secondary outcomes are neonatal mortality, need for surgical closure, duration of ventilator support, chronic lung disease, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, time to full enteral feeds and oliguria. We will search Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) as well as grey literature resources. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract information, and assess the risk of bias (ROB) and the confidence in the estimate (with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach). Subgroup analysis according to gestational age, birth weight, different doses of interventions, time of administration of the first dose of the intervention, and echocardiographic definition of haemodynamically significant PDA and ROB are planned. We will perform a Bayesian network meta-analysis to combine the pooled direct and indirect treatment effect estimates for each outcome, if adequate data are available. Ethics and Dissemination The results will help to reduce the uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of the interventions, will identify knowledge gaps or will encourage further research for other therapeutic options. Therefore, its results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. On the basis of the nature of its design, no ethics approval is necessary for this study.

Revealing Development Trends in Blockchain-Based 5G Network Technologies through Patent Analysis,"The fifth-generation (5G) network has special communication and security requirements including high reliability, low latency, precise automatic control, secure covert transmission, and evidence traceability. The 5G network combined with blockchain technology just meets this demand, so it is driving a rapidly growing volume of patent applications. This study proposes application scenarios, architecture diagrams, and patent analysis methods for blockchain-based 5G network technologies, beginning with a network architecture using mobile edge computing (MEC) and blockchain as independent platform components to solve MEC load pressure. In the patent analysis, a patent cluster map of blockchain-based 5G networks is proposed to analyze the intersection of technical application fields. The bottleneck period of technological development is presented for leading countries and enterprises in the technological development of blockchain-based 5G network, highlighting relative advantages and disadvantages. Specifically, to extract the core international patent classification (IPC) key technologies and their mutual interrelatedness, we use network topology analysis to establish an IPC network topology diagram through node global and local topology characteristics, thus revealing hotspots of IPC technology research and the characteristics of the technology relationship system.
