Application of Artificial Intelligence-Based Technologies in the Healthcare Industry: Opportunities and Challenges,"This study examines the current state of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology applications and their impact on the healthcare industry. In addition to a thorough review of the literature, this study analyzed several real-world examples of AI applications in healthcare. The results indicate that major hospitals are, at present, using AI-enabled systems to augment medical staff in patient diagnosis and treatment activities for a wide range of diseases. In addition, AI systems are making an impact on improving the efficiency of nursing and managerial activities of hospitals. While AI is being embraced positively by healthcare providers, its applications provide both the utopian perspective (new opportunities) and the dystopian view (challenges to overcome). We discuss the details of those opportunities and challenges to provide a balanced view of the value of AI applications in healthcare. It is clear that rapid advances of AI and related technologies will help care providers create new value for their patients and improve the efficiency of their operational processes. Nevertheless, effective applications of AI will require effective planning and strategies to transform the entire care service and operations to reap the benefits of what technologies offer.",https://openalex.org/W3113541070,2021,DonHee Lee; Seong No Yoon,Inha University; Edward Waters University
"Artificial intelligence, robotics, advanced technologies and human resource management: a systematic review","Although academic production in intelligent automation (e.g. artificial intelligence, robotics) has grown rapidly, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the utilization of these technologies in human resource management (HRM) at an organizational (firms) and individual (employees) level. This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research.",https://openalex.org/W3130894836,2021,Demetris Vrontis; Michael Christofi; Vijay Pereira,University of Nicosia; NEOMA Business School

Methodologic Guide for Evaluating Clinical Performance and Effect of Artificial Intelligence Technology for Medical Diagnosis and Prediction,"The use of artificial intelligence in medicine is currently an issue of great interest, especially with regard to the diagnostic or predictive analysis of medical images. Adoption of an artificial intelligence tool in clinical practice requires careful confirmation of its clinical utility. Herein, the authors explain key methodology points involved in a clinical evaluation of artificial intelligence technology for use in medicine, especially high-dimensional or overparameterized diagnostic or predictive models in which artificial deep neural networks are used, mainly from the standpoints of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics. First, statistical methods for assessing the discrimination and calibration performances of a diagnostic or predictive model are summarized. Next, the effects of disease manifestation spectrum and disease prevalence on the performance results are explained, followed by a discussion of the difference between evaluating the performance with use of internal and external datasets, the importance of using an adequate external dataset obtained from a well-defined clinical cohort to avoid overestimating the clinical performance as a result of overfitting in high-dimensional or overparameterized classification model and spectrum bias, and the essentials for achieving a more robust clinical evaluation. Finally, the authors review the role of clinical trials and observational outcome studies for ultimate clinical verification of diagnostic or predictive artificial intelligence tools through patient outcomes, beyond performance metrics, and how to design such studies. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2018.",https://openalex.org/W2783687327,2018,Seong Ho Park; Kyunghwa Han,Asan Medical Center; Ulsan College; University of Ulsan
"Smart Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Algorithms (STARA): Employees’ perceptions of our future workplace","Abstract Futurists predict that a third of jobs that exist today could be taken by Smart Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Algorithms (STARA) by 2025. However, very little is known about how employees perceive these technological advancements in regards to their own jobs and careers, and how they are preparing for these potential changes. A new measure (STARA awareness) was created for this study that captures the extent to which employees feel their job could be replaced by these types of technology. Due to career progression and technology knowledge associated with age, we also tested age as a moderator of STARA. Using a mixed-methods approach on 120 employees, we tested STARA awareness on a range of job and well-being outcomes. Greater STARA awareness was negatively related to organisational commitment and career satisfaction, and positively related to turnover intentions, cynicism, and depression.",https://openalex.org/W2580712957,2017,David Brougham; Jarrod Haar,Massey University; Auckland University of Technology

Constitutional democracy and technology in the age of artificial intelligence,"Given the foreseeable pervasiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern societies, it is legitimate and necessary to ask the question how this new technology must be shaped to support the maintenance and strengthening of constitutional democracy. This paper first describes the four core elements of today's digital power concentration, which need to be seen in cumulation and which, seen together, are both a threat to democracy and to functioning markets. It then recalls the experience with the lawless Internet and the relationship between technology and the law as it has developed in the Internet economy and the experience with GDPR before it moves on to the key question for AI in democracy, namely which of the challenges of AI can be safely and with good conscience left to ethics, and which challenges of AI need to be addressed by rules which are enforceable and encompass the legitimacy of democratic process, thus laws. The paper closes with a call for a new culture of incorporating the principles of democracy, rule of law and human rights by design in AI and a three-level technological impact assessment for new technologies like AI as a practical way forward for this purpose.

Artificial intelligence in developing countries: The impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for development,"This paper explores the potential impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) on developing countries, considering both positive and negative effects across various domains of information, culture, and industry. Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that generate content, such as text, audio, or video, aiming to produce novel and creative outputs based on training data. Compared to conversational artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence systems have the unique capability of not only providing replies but also generating the content of those responses. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence during the Fourth Industrial Revolution, exemplified by tools like ChatGPT, have gained popularity and reshaped content production and creation. However, the benefits of generative artificial intelligence are not equally accessible to all, especially in developing countries, where limited access to cutting-edge technologies and inadequate infrastructure pose challenges. This paper seeks to understand the potential impact of generative AI technologies on developing countries, considering economic growth, access to technology, and the potential paradigm shift in education, healthcare, and the environment. The findings emphasize the importance of providing the necessary support and infrastructure to ensure that generative AI contributes to inclusive development rather than deepening existing inequalities. The study highlights the significance of integrating Generative AI into the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in developing countries, where technological change is a crucial determinant of progress and equitable growth.",https://openalex.org/W4386729081,2023,Nishith Reddy Mannuru; Sakib Shahriar; Zoë Abbie Teel,University of North Texas; University of Guelph
Accounting and auditing with blockchain technology and artificial Intelligence: A literature review,"Copyright © 2022 The Authors. This paper surveys the published work on how blockchain technology will impact accounting in general, but AI-enabled auditing specifically. The purpose is to investigate how blockchain technology can improve transparency and trust in accounting practice and how professionals can use blockchain data to improve decision-making, based on the qualities of immutability, append-only, shared, verified, and agreed-upon (i.e., consensus-driven) blockchain data. The multi-party validation of blockchain protocols adds real-time trusted data for the AI systems used by auditors to improve assurance and efficiency. This review summarizes four themes emerging from the literature focusing on how blockchain technology has changed record-keeping in accounting: event approach to accounting; real-time accounting; triple entry-accounting and continuous auditing. The research interprets the findings using agency theory and stakeholder theory to advance how using blockchain to mitigate information asymmetry and improve stakeholder collaborations is understood. The investigation also summarizes the challenges and clarifies organizations’ reasons to be cautious about adopting blockchain. Lastly, the study suggests that future researchers use this study in two ways that enrich blockchain literature: first, to apply the themes and answer the questions identified within this review to improve the business methods of practitioners and policymakers; and second, to encourage stakeholders such as practitioners, system designers/developers, and policymakers to collaborate in designing blockchain ecosystems that suit accounting and auditing as they transform digitally.",https://openalex.org/W4310021468,2022,Hongdan Han; Radha K.

"Birth of Industry 5.0: Making Sense of Big Data with Artificial Intelligence, “The Internet of Things” and Next-Generation Technology Policy","Abstract Driverless cars with artificial intelligence (AI) and automated supermarkets run by collaborative robots (cobots) working without human supervision have sparked off new debates: what will be the impacts of extreme automation, turbocharged by the Internet of Things (IoT), AI, and the Industry 4.0, on Big Data and omics implementation science? The IoT builds on (1) broadband wireless internet connectivity, (2) miniaturized sensors embedded in animate and inanimate objects ranging from the house cat to the milk carton in your smart fridge, and (3) AI and cobots making sense of Big Data collected by sensors. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech strategy for manufacturing automation that employs the IoT, thus creating the Smart Factory. Extreme automation until “everything is connected to everything else” poses, however, vulnerabilities that have been little considered to date. First, highly integrated systems are vulnerable to systemic risks such as total network collapse in the event of failure of one of its parts, for example, by hacking or Internet viruses that can fully invade integrated systems. Second, extreme connectivity creates new social and political power structures. If left unchecked, they might lead to authoritarian governance by one person in total control of network power, directly or through her/his connected surrogates. We propose Industry 5.0 that can democratize knowledge coproduction from Big Data, building on the new concept of symmetrical innovation. Industry 5.0 utilizes IoT, but differs from predecessor automation systems by having three-dimensional (3D) symmetry in innovation ecosystem design: (1) a built-in safe exit strategy in case of demise of hyperconnected entrenched digital knowledge networks. Importantly, such safe exists are orthogonal—in that they allow “digital detox” by employing pathways unrelated/unaffected by automated networks, for example, electronic patient records versus material/article trails on vital medical information; (2) equal emphasis on both acceleration and deceleration of innovation if diminishing returns become apparent; and (3) next generation social science and humanities (SSH) research for global governance of emerging technologies: “Post-ELSI Technology Evaluation Research” (PETER). Importantly, PETER considers the technology opportunity costs, ethics, ethics-of-ethics, framings (epistemology), independence, and reflexivity of SSH research in technology policymaking. Industry 5.0 is poised to harness extreme automation and Big Data with safety, innovative technology policy, and responsible implementation science, enabled by 3D symmetry in innovation ecosystem design.",https://openalex.org/W2781661799,2018,Vural Özdemir; Nezih Hekim,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham; Biruni University

Development and evaluation of a low-cost and smart technology for precision weed management utilizing artificial intelligence,"Most conventional sprayers apply agrochemicals uniformly, despite the fact that distribution of weeds is typically patchy, resulting in wastage of valuable compounds, increased costs, crop damage risk, pest resistance to chemicals, environmental pollution and contamination of products. To reduce these negative impacts, a smart sprayer was designed and developed utilizing machine vision and artificial intelligence to distinguish target weeds from non-target objects (e.g. vegetable crops) and precisely spray on the desired target/location. Two different experimental scenarios were designed to simulate a vegetable field and to evaluate the smart sprayer’s performance. The first scenario contained artificial weeds (targets) and artificial plants (non-targets). The second and most challenging scenario contained real plants; portulaca weeds as targets, and sedge weeds and pepper plants as non-targets. Two different embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) were evaluated as the smart sprayer processing unit (for image processing and target detection). The more powerful GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti) achieved an overall precision of 71% and recall of 78% (for plant detection and target spraying accuracy) on the most challenging scenario with real plants, and 91% accuracy and recall for the first scenario with artificial plants. The less powerful GPU (NVIDIA Jetson TX2) achieved an overall precision and recall of 90% and 89% respectively on the first scenario with artificial plants, and 59% and 44% respectively on the second scenario with real plants. Finally, an RTK GPS was connected to the smart sprayer and an algorithm was developed to automatically generate weed maps and visualize the collected data (after every application). This smart technology integrates a state of the art (AI-based) weed detection system, a novel fast and precision spraying system, and a weed mapping system. It can significantly reduce the quantity of agrochemicals required, especially compared with traditional broadcast sprayers that usually treat the entire field, resulting in unnecessary application to areas that do not require treatment. It could also reduce costs, risk of crop damage and excess herbicide residue, as well as potentially reduce environmental impact.",https://openalex.org/W2908783980,2019,Victor Partel; Sri Charan Kakarla; Yiannis Ampatzidis,Southwest Florida Research; University of Florida

Intention to use analytical artificial intelligence (AI) in services – the effect of technology readiness and awareness,"Purpose The automation of services is rapidly growing, led by sectors such as banking and financial investment. The growing number of investments managed by artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that this technology-based service will become increasingly popular. This study examines how customers' technology readiness and service awareness affect their intention to use analytical AI investment services. Design/methodology/approach Hypotheses were tested with a data set of 404 North American-based potential customers of robo-advisors. In addition to technology readiness dimensions, the potential customers' characteristics were included in the framework as moderating factors (age, gender and previous experience with financial investment services). A post-hoc analysis examined the roles of service awareness and the financial advisor's name (i.e., robo-advisor vs. AI-advisor). Findings The results indicated that customers' technological optimism increases, and insecurity decreases, their intention to use robo-advisors. Surprisingly, feelings of technological discomfort positively influenced robo-advisor adoption. This interesting finding challenges previous insights into technology adoption and value co-creation as analytical AI puts customers into a very passive role and reduces barriers to technology adoption. The research also analyzes how consumers become aware of robo-advisors, and how this influences their acceptance. Originality/value This is the first study to analyze the role of customers' technology readiness in the adoption of analytical AI. The authors link the findings to previous technology adoption and automated services' literature and provide specific managerial implications and avenues for further research.",https://openalex.org/W3199205423,2021,Carlos Flavián; Alfredo Pérez-Rueda; Daniel Belanche,Universidad de Zaragoza

How will artificial intelligence and Industry 4.0 emerging technologies transform operations management?,"Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, additive manufacturing, advanced robotics, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things are frequently mentioned as part of “Industry 4.0.” As such, how will they influence operations and supply chain management? We answer this question by providing a brief review of the evolution of technologies and operations management (OM) over time. Because terms such as “Industry 4.0” do not have a precise definition, we focus on more fundamental issues raised by Industry 4.0 emerging technologies for research in OM. We propose a theory of disruptive debottlenecking and the SACE framework by classifying emerging technologies in terms of the functionalities they enable: sense, analyze, collaborate, and execute. Subsequently, we review the nascent but rapidly growing literature at the interface between digital technologies and OM. Our review suggests that one way to assess the value of Industry 4.0 technologies can be via their influence on adding revenues, differentiating, reducing costs, optimizing risks, innovating, and transforming business models and processes.

Artificial intelligence technologies and compassion in healthcare: A systematic scoping review,"Background Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, together with the availability of big data in society, creates uncertainties about how these developments will affect healthcare systems worldwide. Compassion is essential for high-quality healthcare and research shows how prosocial caring behaviors benefit human health and societies. However, the possible association between AI technologies and compassion is under conceptualized and underexplored. Objectives The aim of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive depth and a balanced perspective of the emerging topic of AI technologies and compassion, to inform future research and practice. The review questions were: How is compassion discussed in relation to AI technologies in healthcare? How are AI technologies being used to enhance compassion in healthcare? What are the gaps in current knowledge and unexplored potential? What are the key areas where AI technologies could support compassion in healthcare? Materials and methods A systematic scoping review following five steps of Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Presentation of the scoping review conforms with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Eligibility criteria were defined according to 3 concept constructs (AI technologies, compassion, healthcare) developed from the literature and informed by medical subject headings (MeSH) and key words for the electronic searches. Sources of evidence were Web of Science and PubMed databases, articles published in English language 2011–2022. Articles were screened by title/abstract using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data extracted (author, date of publication, type of article, aim/context of healthcare, key relevant findings, country) was charted using data tables. Thematic analysis used an inductive-deductive approach to generate code categories from the review questions and the data. A multidisciplinary team assessed themes for resonance and relevance to research and practice. Results Searches identified 3,124 articles. A total of 197 were included after screening. The number of articles has increased over 10 years (2011, n = 1 to 2021, n = 47 and from Jan–Aug 2022 n = 35 articles). Overarching themes related to the review questions were: (1) Developments and debates (7 themes) Concerns about AI ethics, healthcare jobs, and loss of empathy; Human-centered design of AI technologies for healthcare; Optimistic speculation AI technologies will address care gaps; Interrogation of what it means to be human and to care; Recognition of future potential for patient monitoring, virtual proximity, and access to healthcare; Calls for curricula development and healthcare professional education; Implementation of AI applications to enhance health and wellbeing of the healthcare workforce. (2) How AI technologies enhance compassion (10 themes) Empathetic awareness; Empathetic response and relational behavior; Communication skills; Health coaching; Therapeutic interventions; Moral development learning; Clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; Healthcare quality assessment; Therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; Providing health information and advice. (3) Gaps in knowledge (4 themes) Educational effectiveness of AI-assisted learning; Patient diversity and AI technologies; Implementation of AI technologies in education and practice settings; Safety and clinical effectiveness of AI technologies. (4) Key areas for development (3 themes) Enriching education, learning and clinical practice; Extending healing spaces; Enhancing healing relationships. Conclusion There is an association between AI technologies and compassion in healthcare and interest in this association has grown internationally over the last decade. In a range of healthcare contexts, AI technologies are being used to enhance empathetic awareness; empathetic response and relational behavior; communication skills; health coaching; therapeutic interventions; moral development learning; clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; healthcare quality assessment; therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; and to provide health information and advice. The findings inform a reconceptualization of compassion as a human-AI system of intelligent caring comprising six elements: (1) Awareness of suffering (e.g., pain, distress, risk, disadvantage); (2) Understanding the suffering (significance, context, rights, responsibilities etc.); (3) Connecting with the suffering (e.g., verbal, physical, signs and symbols); (4) Making a judgment about the suffering (the need to act); (5) Responding with an intention to alleviate the suffering; (6) Attention to the effect and outcomes of the response. These elements can operate at an individual (human or machine) and collective systems level (healthcare organizations or systems) as a cyclical system to alleviate different types of suffering. New and novel approaches to human-AI intelligent caring could enrich education, learning, and clinical practice; extend healing spaces; and enhance healing relationships. Implications In a complex adaptive system such as healthcare, human-AI intelligent caring will need to be implemented, not as an ideology, but through strategic choices, incentives, regulation, professional education, and training, as well as through joined up thinking about human-AI intelligent caring. Research funders can encourage research and development into the topic of AI technologies and compassion as a system of human-AI intelligent caring. Educators, technologists, and health professionals can inform themselves about the system of human-AI intelligent caring.",https://openalex.org/W4316669402,2023,Elizabeth Morrow; Teodor Zidaru; Fiona Ross,Northern Ireland Hospice; London School of Economics and Political Science; Kingston University

Acceptance of artificial intelligence in German agriculture: an application of the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior,"Abstract The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in agriculture is expected to yield advantages such as savings in production resources, labor costs, and working hours as well as a reduction in soil compaction. However, the economic and ecological benefits of AI systems for agriculture can only be realized if farmers are willing to use them. This study applies the technology acceptance model (TAM) of Davis (1989) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) of Ajzen (1991) to investigate which behavioral factors are influencing the acceptance of AI in agriculture. The composite model is extended by two additional factors, expectation of property rights over business data and personal innovativeness. A structural equation analysis is used to determine the importance of factors influencing the acceptance of AI systems in agriculture. For this purpose, 84 farmers were surveyed with a letter or an online questionnaire. Results show that the perceived behavioral control has the greatest influence on acceptance, followed by farmers’ personal attitude towards AI systems in agriculture. The modelled relationships explain 59% of the total variance in acceptance. Several options and implications on how to increase the acceptance of AI systems in agriculture are discussed.",https://openalex.org/W3166769082,2021,Svenja Mohr; Rainer Kühl,Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen

Student perspectives on the use of generative artificial intelligence technologies in higher education,"Abstract The aim of this project was to understand student perspectives on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies such as Chat generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), in order to inform changes to the University of Liverpool Academic Integrity code of practice. The survey for this study was created by a library student team and vetted through focus groups. A total of 2555 students participated in the survey. Results showed that only 7% of students who responded had not heard of any GAI technologies, whilst over half had used or considered using these for academic purposes. The majority of students (54.1%) were supportive or somewhat supportive of using tools such as Grammarly, but 70.4% were unsupportive or somewhat unsupportive towards students using tools such as ChatGPT to write their whole essay. Students who had higher levels of confidence in their academic writing were less likely to use or consider using them for academic purposes, and were also less likely to be supportive of other students using them. Most students (41.1%) also thought there should be a university wide policy on when these technologies are or are not appropriate to use. The results of this research suggest that students require clear policies on the use of GAI and that these technologies should not be banned from university, but consideration must be made to ensure different groups of students have equal access to the technologies.",https://openalex.org/W4392732989,2024,Heather Johnston; Rebecca Wells; Elizabeth M.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Technology Driven Modern Drug Discovery and Development,"The discovery and advances of medicines may be considered as the ultimate relevant translational science effort that adds to human invulnerability and happiness. But advancing a fresh medication is a quite convoluted, costly, and protracted operation, normally costing USD ~2.6 billion and consuming a mean time span of 12 years. Methods to cut back expenditure and hasten new drug discovery have prompted an arduous and compelling brainstorming exercise in the pharmaceutical industry. The engagement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including the deep-learning (DL) component in particular, has been facilitated by the employment of classified big data, in concert with strikingly reinforced computing prowess and cloud storage, across all fields. AI has energized computer-facilitated drug discovery. An unrestricted espousing of machine learning (ML), especially DL, in many scientific specialties, and the technological refinements in computing hardware and software, in concert with various aspects of the problem, sustain this progress. ML algorithms have been extensively engaged for computer-facilitated drug discovery. DL methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) comprising multiple buried processing layers, have of late seen a resurgence due to their capability to power automatic attribute elicitations from the input data, coupled with their ability to obtain nonlinear input-output pertinencies. Such features of DL methods augment classical ML techniques which bank on human-contrived molecular descriptors. A major part of the early reluctance concerning utility of AI in pharmaceutical discovery has begun to melt, thereby advancing medicinal chemistry. AI, along with modern experimental technical knowledge, is anticipated to invigorate the quest for new and improved pharmaceuticals in an expeditious, economical, and increasingly compelling manner. DL-facilitated methods have just initiated kickstarting for some integral issues in drug discovery. Many technological advances, such as “message-passing paradigms”, “spatial-symmetry-preserving networks”, “hybrid de novo design”, and other ingenious ML exemplars, will definitely come to be pervasively widespread and help dissect many of the biggest, and most intriguing inquiries. Open data allocation and model augmentation will exert a decisive hold during the progress of drug discovery employing AI. This review will address the impending utilizations of AI to refine and bolster the drug discovery operation.",https://openalex.org/W4317625850,2023,Chayna Sarkar; Biswadeep Das; Vikram Singh Rawat,North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences; All India Institute of Medical Sciences Rishikesh

"Green Artificial Intelligence: Towards an Efficient, Sustainable and Equitable Technology for Smart Cities and Futures","Smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI) are among the most popular discourses in urban policy circles. Most attempts at using AI to improve efficiencies in cities have nevertheless either struggled or failed to accomplish the smart city transformation. This is mainly due to short-sighted, technologically determined and reductionist AI approaches being applied to complex urbanization problems. Besides this, as smart cities are underpinned by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make efficient, sustainable and equitable decisions, the need for a green AI approach is intensified. This perspective paper, reflecting authors’ opinions and interpretations, concentrates on the “green AI” concept as an enabler of the smart city transformation, as it offers the opportunity to move away from purely technocentric efficiency solutions towards efficient, sustainable and equitable solutions capable of realizing the desired urban futures. The aim of this perspective paper is two-fold: first, to highlight the fundamental shortfalls in mainstream AI system conceptualization and practice, and second, to advocate the need for a consolidated AI approach—i.e., green AI—to further support smart city transformation. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current AI and smart city literatures, practices, developments, trends and applications. The paper informs authorities and planners on the importance of the adoption and deployment of AI systems that address efficiency, sustainability and equity issues in cities.",https://openalex.org/W3192495768,2021,Tan Yiğitcanlar; Rashid Mehmood; Juan M.

Artificial Intelligence in Innovation: How to Spot Emerging Trends and Technologies,"Firms apply strategic foresight in technology and innovation management to detect discontinuous changes early, to assess their expected consequences, and to develop a future course of action enabling superior company performance. For this purpose, an ever-increasing amount of data has to be collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Still, a major part of these activities is performed manually, which requires high investments in various resources. To support these processes more efficiently, this article presents an artificial-intelligence-based data mining model that helps firms spot emerging topics and trends at a higher level of automation than before. Its modular structure consists of components for query generation, data collection, data preprocessing, topic modeling, topic analysis, and visualization, combined in such a way that only a minimum amount of manual effort is required during its initial set up. The approach also incorporates self-adaptive capabilities, allowing the model to automatically update itself once new data has become available. The model parameterization is based on latest research in this area, and its threshold parameter is learnt during supervised training using a training data set. We have applied our model to an independent test data set to verify its effectiveness as an early warning system. By means of a retrospective analysis, we show in three case studies that our model is able to identify emerging technologies prior to their first publication in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies. Based on our findings, we derive both theoretical and practical implications for the technology and innovation management of firms, and we suggest future research opportunities to further advance this field.",https://openalex.org/W3029931105,2020,Christian Mühlroth; Michael Grottke,Schiller International University; GfK (Germany)
Examining artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in marketing via a global lens: Current trends and future research opportunities,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has captured substantial interest from a wide array of marketing scholars in recent years. Our research contributes to this emerging domain by examining AI technologies in marketing via a global lens. Specifically, our lens focuses on three levels of analysis: country, company, and consumer. Our country-level analysis emphasizes the heterogeneity in economic inequality across countries due to the considerable economic resources necessary for AI adoption. Our company-level analysis focuses on glocalization because while the hardware that underlies these technologies may be global in nature, their application necessitates adaptation to local cultures. Our consumer-level analysis examines consumer ethics and privacy concerns, as AI technologies often collect, store and process a cornucopia of personal data across our globe. Through the prism of these three lenses, we focus on two important dimensions of AI technologies in marketing: (1) human–machine interaction and (2) automated analysis of text, audio, images, and video. We then explore the interaction between these two key dimensions of AI across our three-part global lens to develop a set of research questions for future marketing scholarship in this increasingly important domain.",https://openalex.org/W3214567845,2021,Praveen K.

"Prerequisites for artificial intelligence in further education: identification of drivers, barriers, and business models of educational technology companies","Abstract The ongoing datafication of our social reality has resulted in the emergence of new data-based business models. This development is also reflected in the education market. An increasing number of educational technology (EdTech) companies are entering the traditional education market with data-based teaching and learning solutions, and they are permanently transforming the market. However, despite the current market dynamics, there are hardly any business models that implement the possibilities of Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create adaptive teaching and learning paths. This paper focuses on EdTech companies and the drivers and barriers that currently affect data-based teaching and learning paths. The results show that LA especially are integrated into the current business models of EdTech companies on three levels, which are as follows: basic Learning Analytics, Learning Analytics and algorithmic or human-based recommendations, and Learning Analytics and adaptive teaching and learning (AI based). The discourse analysis reveals a diametrical relationship between the traditional educational ideal and the futuristic idea of education and knowledge transfer. While the desire for flexibility and individualization drives the debate on AI-based learning systems, a lack of data sovereignty, uncertainty and a lack of understanding of data are holding back the development and implementation of appropriate solutions at the same time.",https://openalex.org/W3028852563,2020,André Renz; Romy Hilbig,Weizenbaum Institute

Artificial Intelligence and Health Technology Assessment: Anticipating a New Level of Complexity,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen as a strategic lever to improve access, quality, and efficiency of care and services and to build learning and value-based health systems. Many studies have examined the technical performance of AI within an experimental context. These studies provide limited insights into the issues that its use in a real-world context of care and services raises. To help decision makers address these issues in a systemic and holistic manner, this viewpoint paper relies on the health technology assessment core model to contrast the expectations of the health sector toward the use of AI with the risks that should be mitigated for its responsible deployment. The analysis adopts the perspective of payers (ie, health system organizations and agencies) because of their central role in regulating, financing, and reimbursing novel technologies. This paper suggests that AI-based systems should be seen as a health system transformation lever, rather than a discrete set of technological devices. Their use could bring significant changes and impacts at several levels: technological, clinical, human and cognitive (patient and clinician), professional and organizational, economic, legal, and ethical. The assessment of AI’s value proposition should thus go beyond technical performance and cost logic by performing a holistic analysis of its value in a real-world context of care and services. To guide AI development, generate knowledge, and draw lessons that can be translated into action, the right political, regulatory, organizational, clinical, and technological conditions for innovation should be created as a first step.",https://openalex.org/W3024478970,2020,Hassane Alami; Pascale Lehoux; Yannick Auclair,Institut National d'Excellence en Santé et en Services Sociaux; Université de Montréal

Existing AI and IoT studies detect plant diseases by images or nonimage hyperspectral data, which require manual operations to obtain the photographs or data for analysis. Also, image detection typically is too late as rice blast may already spread to other plants. Based on an IoT platform for soil cultivation, we develop the RiceTalk project that utilizes nonimage IoT devices to detect rice blast. Unlike the image-based plant disease detection approaches, our agriculture sensors generate nonimage data that can be automatically trained and analyzed by the AI mechanism in real time. The beauty of RiceTalk is that the AI model is treated as an IoT device and is managed like other IoT devices. In this way, our approach significantly reduces the platform management cost to provide real-time training and predictions. We also propose an innovative spore germination mechanism as a new feature extraction model for agriculture. In the current implementation, the accuracy of the RiceTalk prediction on rice blast is 89.4%.",https://openalex.org/W2980702392,2019,Wenliang Chen; Yi‐Bing Lin; Fung-Ling Ng,National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University

Applications of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies for enabling prosumers in smart grids: A review,"Governments’ net zero emission target aims at increasing the share of renewable energy sources as well as influencing the behaviours of consumers to support the cost-effective balancing of energy supply and demand. These will be achieved by the advanced information and control infrastructures of smart grids which allow the interoperability among various stakeholders. Under this circumstance, increasing number of consumers produce, store, and consume energy, giving them a new role of prosumers. The integration of prosumers and accommodation of incurred bidirectional flows of energy and information rely on two key factors: flexible structures of energy markets and intelligent operations of power systems. The blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) are innovative technologies to fulfil these two factors, by which the blockchain provides decentralised trading platforms for energy markets and the AI supports the optimal operational control of power systems. This paper attempts to address how to incorporate the blockchain and AI in the smart grids for facilitating prosumers to participate in energy markets. To achieve this objective, first, this paper reviews how policy designs price carbon emissions caused by the fossil-fuel based generation so as to facilitate the integration of prosumers with renewable energy sources. Second, the potential structures of energy markets with the support of the blockchain technologies are discussed. Last, how to apply the AI for enhancing the state monitoring and decision making during the operations of power systems is introduced.",https://openalex.org/W4221039087,2022,Weiqi Hua; Ying Chen; Meysam Qadrdan,University of Oxford; Cardiff University
The Robots are Coming … But Aren't Here Yet: The Use of Artificial Intelligence Technologies in the Public Accounting Profession,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we survey public accounting professionals to gauge the extent to which Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Machine Learning (ML), are currently being utilized, as well as perceptions about the impact and receptiveness to this technology. Quantitative and qualitative responses from 90 participants, representing various firms, service lines, and positions, indicate that both RPA and ML are currently not being used extensively by public accountants nor by their clients, and firms are conducting some, but not extensive training on these technologies. However, respondents strongly indicated that AI will significantly impact their daily responsibilities in five years and public accountants are very receptive to these changes. Additionally, we find that firm size appears to be the most significant factor impacting differences in responses. These results indicate that while large-scale AI adoption has not yet come to public accounting, substantial changes are on the horizon.",https://openalex.org/W3037226706,2020,Kathleen M.

Cognitive Technologies and Artificial Intelligence in Social Perception,"Abstract Cognitive technologies and artificial intelligence dynamize the development of the modern world in various spheres. Modern man is not always aware of how often he uses this type of technology, both in everyday life and at work. The conducted literature research has shown a growing interest in the discussed issues. The diagnostic survey allowed the assessment of the level of familiarity with the terms “cognitive technologies” and “artificial intelligence” in the perception of students, doctoral students and employees of a selected university. The auditorium survey technique was used for the research. The research shows that the distance between humans and an intelligent robot is decreasing. A man is inclined to let intelligent robots enter even the most intimate spheres of his life. The article contributes to filling the gap in knowledge about the perception and application of intelligent technologies and the readiness to use them. Furthermore, it sets out further directions for research on this phenomenon.",https://openalex.org/W4280610215,2022,Aleksandra Kuzior; Aleksy Kwiliński,Silesian University of Technology; Sumy State University
"COVID‐19 and the New Technologies of Organizing: Digital Exhaust, Digital Footprints, and Artificial Intelligence in the Wake of Remote Work","Companies have flirted with remote work since the 1970s. Estimates from late 2019 suggested that slightly more than 5 per cent of employees worked remotely with regularity. But as COVID-19 has spread across the globe over the past few months, and shelter-in-place orders were issued by governments, many companies have initiated a rapid and wholesale shift to remote work arrangements, at least for knowledge-intensive work. This shift is enabled by digital technologies that allow workers to communicate via text, audio, and video and to share and edit data and documents in real-time. As examples of the dramatic and swift increase in remote work enabled by digital technologies, Zoom's daily active user base grew by 67 per cent in March 2020, the number of daily active users of Microsoft Teams grew from 20 million in November 2019 to 44 million in March 2020, and Slack added 7,000 new paid customers in February and March, 2020 – roughly 40 per cent more than in each of its previous two quarters. Google announced it will continue remote work until at least summer 2021 and Twitter extended the opportunity for all employees to work remotely indefinitely. Most discussions around this shift to remote work have focused on exploring first-order effects – areas of organizational behaviour that are likely to change directly following a transition to working exclusively through digital technologies. Although first-order effects are important, it is the second-order effects of remote working that have the potential to be the most profound, but are the most understudied. In this paper, I explore three of the most important second-order effects likely to shape the trajectory of work for several decades: (1) Remote work creates vast amounts of digital exhaust, (2) Digital exhaust is used to turn employees into data representations, and (3) Artificial intelligence (AI) uses those data representations to predict (and shape) employee behaviour. Increases in the use of digital technologies produces corresponding increases in the amount of work that is recorded and stored. Every time employees send each other emails via Outlook, message each other on Slack, initiate a video conference in Zoom, like someone's post on Jive, form a team in Microsoft Teams, or assign someone to project milestones in Trello, these digital technologies record that action as meta-data. Whereas most office-based employees conduct slightly more than 50 per cent of their communications through digital channels, record roughly 25 per cent of their meetings, or document how they approached a particular work task some 10 per cent of the time (all figures according to my own research), remote workers in the age of COVID-19 are conducting nearly ALL of these activities through digital technologies that create time-stamped logs of their behaviour. These meta-data are digital exhaust. Logs of employee behaviour are called digital exhaust because they are by-products of other activities, like setting up a meeting or running calculations. Although the term 'exhaust' may signal the inadvertent nature of such digital records and connote worthlessness, nothing could be further from the truth. In my own research, I have documented how digital exhaust can be used to help employees reduce work duplication and increase innovation (Leonardi, 2014), develop more accurate organizational metaknowledge – knowledge of 'who knows what' and 'who knows who' (Leonardi, 2015), and apportion work tasks more effectively (Leonardi, 2018). Organizational leaders who collect and analyse digital exhaust created by employees can develop efficient systems for knowledge transfer (Leonardi and Meyer, 2015) more effectively implement strategy (Neeley and Leonardi, 2018), and identify individuals whose networks are optimized for certain roles (Leonardi and Contractor, 2018). To more thoroughly explore the kinds of digital exhaust produced by remote work, researchers might ask questions such as: How do workers/managers interpret signals from one's digital exhaust? How does access to colleagues' digital exhaust shape an organization's knowledge economy or power structure? What are the ethics of granting access to other people's digital exhaust and what implications does it have for organizational justice and equity? By themselves, individual particles of digital exhaust contain very little meaning. For example, if an employee starts work late one day (as recorded by VPN login times), spends an unusually short amount of time working with information in a portal (as recorded by server-side time-stamps), and is unusually quiet in a meeting (as recorded by total seconds of talk-time in a Zoom session), none of these pieces of digital exhaust by themselves tells us much. But when those pieces are combined, examined over time to qualify a pattern of behaviour, and compared to other employees' patterns, they can start to create inferences that an employee is, for example, disconnecting from the organization. Putting these pieces of digital exhaust together allows companies to construct digital footprints of employees, teams, and sub-units. Digital footprints are collections of data that represent an entity. They are the mathematical representation of everything a company knows about that entity and they are used to make predictions about its behaviour. Digital footprints are constantly updated as the entity produces more digital exhaust. In my research, I have documented how employees who recognize that their mediated activities allow companies to create digital footprints of them sometimes feel as though they are being surveilled by peers and leaders, causing them to act in ways that leave purposeful patterns of exhaust that effectively game the system (Leonardi and Treem, 2012). I've also shown how the creation of digital footprints can create a vicious cycle in which employees feel that everyone else's actions are more visible than theirs, thus compelling them to work more so as to enable the company to produce a digital footprint of them suggesting they are exceptionally hard workers: These employees experience high levels of burnout (Cristea and Leonardi, 2019). Because the volume of digital exhaust produced in the era of COVID-19 is prodigious, organizations increasingly use algorithms that code digital exhaust into particular categories of action, sort those categories, and perform complex computations that link them together. The result is that algorithms are increasingly central in turning employees' digital exhaust into digital footprints that serve as data representations of them. To explore this process, scholars might ask: Under what conditions do managers and leaders become confident that digital footprints are accurate representation of employee behaviour? What changes arise when employees become aware that management is observing their work by attending to their digital footprints? In what ways can digital footprints aid in mentoring and coaching and in what ways will they serve as warrants for disciplinary action or censure? It is only in the past several years that the computational power and development of mathematics undergirding AI have progressed far enough to make meaningful predictions based on people's digital footprints. Although many companies were ready to analyse data at scale, they didn't have enough of it to analyse because most employees' actions were not recorded and stored. COVID-19 solved that problem. Today, companies are beginning to use algorithms to sift through the digital footprints assembled as remote workers create digital exhaust. The most advanced companies are using AI to combine these patterns with new datasets (like employee turnover or performance data) to test assumptions about certain relationships, learn autonomously from these tests, and, make predictions about future employee behaviour. These predictions can set the stage for managerial and organizational policy decisions. As organizations increasingly make use of algorithms to sort through the glut of digital exhaust they collect and store, employees are sometimes unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged by the way those data are turned into predictions by AI (Leonardi and Treem, in press). It is clear that the vast amounts of digital exhaust produced through remote work arrangements can improve organizational behaviour in many ways, but they also threaten to undermine some of the very systems, processes and institutions that make workplaces fair and equitable. Most of the digital tools organizations implement to help with remote work are cloud-based applications hosted by vendors whose contract rights give them access to some or all of the digital exhaust produced through them. Those vendors are able to use algorithmic modelling to create macro-level digital footprints of the behaviour of people and organizations and use AI to make predictions. They sell those predictions to other companies that market to us and bid to consult with our organizations, and they use those digital footprints to improve their own technologies in ways that allow them to collect even more digital exhaust. Zuboff (2019) has written eloquently about how vendors monetize digital exhaust and use it to construct digital footprints that predict and shape our behaviour. To explore how AI is used to turn digital footprints into predictions, researchers might begin to ask questions like: How will leaders incorporate AI-based predictions into their decision-making processes? Should organizations be required to let employees see predictions of their own behaviour and what are the consequences of this choice? Under what conditions do predictions of employee behaviour instigate a set of compensatory activities that turn them into self-fulfilling prophecies? Some observers argue that we are entering an era in which remote work will be the 'new normal'. If that prediction comes true, it means that people, teams, and organizations will be quantified, modelled, and shaped in heretofore unknown ways. Others argue that remote work will not become mainstream soon and that most workers will return to offices when the pandemic subsides, will resume activities in which they work outside of digital technologies, and will produce much less digital exhaust. If that vision of the future comes true, it is unlikely to portend any less of a dramatic shift in the way organizations operate than if people remain working remotely. That is because the scale and duration of remote work that COVID-19 has enabled has already produced so much digital exhaust that companies will build models from this unique window of time for decades to come. Regardless of whether remote work remains common or whether it becomes another brief spike in the long history of starts and stops since the 1970s, it is very likely that the digital footprints produced during COVID-19 will serve the basis for many organizational practices, policies, and ideologies in the future. It is these second-order effects of remote work that need to be understood, discussed, and debated today so that organizational scholars can provide the insights that will allow us to thoughtfully build and manage the organizations of tomorrow.",https://openalex.org/W3090360564,2020,Paul M.

"Artificial Intelligence-Empowered Edge of Vehicles: Architecture, Enabling Technologies, and Applications","With the proliferation of mobile devices and a wealth of rich application services, the Internet of vehicles (IoV) has struggled to handle computationally intensive and delay-sensitive computing tasks. To substantially reduce the latency and the energy consumption, application work is offloaded from a mobile device to a remote cloud or a nearby mobile edge cloud for processing. Compared with remote clouds, mobile edge clouds are located at the edge of the network. Therefore, mobile edge computing (MEC) has the advantages of effectively utilizing idle computing and storage resources at the edge of the network and reducing the network transmission delay. In addition, mobile devices are increasingly moving toward intelligence. To satisfy the service experience and service quality requirements of mobile users, the vehicle Internet is transforming into the intelligent vehicle Internet. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology can adapt to rapidly changing dynamic environments to provide multiple task requirements for resource allocation, computational task scheduling, and vehicle trajectory prediction. On this basis, combined with MEC technology and AI technology, computing and storage resources are placed on the edge of the network to provide real-time data processing while providing more efficient and intelligent services. This article introduces IoV from three aspects, namely, MEC, AI and the advantages of combining the two, and analyzes the corresponding architecture and implementation technology. The application of MEC and AI in IoV is analyzed and compared with current approaches. Finally, several promising future directions in the field of IoV are discussed.",https://openalex.org/W3013476223,2020,Hongjing Ji; Osama Alfarraj; Amr Tolba,Dalian University of Technology; Taiyuan University of Technology; King Saud University

Incorporating Artificial Intelligence Technology in Smart Greenhouses: Current State of the Art,"This article presents the current state-of-the-art research on applying artificial intelligence (AI) technology in smart greenhouses to optimize crop yields, water, and fertilizer use efficiency, to reduce pest and disease, and to enhance agricultural sustainability. The key technologies of interest were robotic systems for pesticide application, irrigation, harvesting, bio-inspired algorithms for the automation of greenhouse processes, energy management, machine path planning and operation of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), resolution of scheduling problems, and image signal processing for pest and disease diagnosis. Additionally, the review investigated the cost benefits of various energy-management and AI-based energy-saving technologies, the integration of photovoltaics and dynamic pricing based on real-time and time-of-use metrics, and the cost benefits of LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, mobile, and RFID (radiofrequency identification) technologies. The review established that commercially viable AI technologies for agriculture had increased exponentially. For example, AI-based irrigation and soil fertilizer application enabled farmers to realize higher returns on investment on fertilizer application and gross returns above the fertilizer cost, higher yields, and resource use efficiency. Similarly, AI image detection techniques led to the early diagnosis of powdery mildew. The precise operation of agricultural robots was supported by the integration of light imaging, detection, and ranging (LIDAR) optical and electro-optical cameras in place of the traditional GPS (geographic positioning systems) technologies, which are prone to errors. However, critical challenges remained unresolved, including cost, disparities between research and development (R&amp;D) innovations and technology commercialization, energy use, the tradeoff between accuracy and computational speeds, and technology gaps between the Global North and South. In general, the value of this review is that it surveys the literature on the maturity level of various AI technologies in smart greenhouses and offers a state-of-the-art picture of how far the technologies have successfully been applied in agriculture and what can be done to optimize their usability.",https://openalex.org/W4313467117,2022,Chrysanthos Maraveas,Agricultural University of Athens
Where medical education meets artificial intelligence: ‘Does technology care?’,"Abstract ‘Cold’ technologies and ‘warm’ hands‐on medicine need to walk hand‐in‐hand Technologies, such as deep learning artificial intelligence (AI), promise benign solutions to thorny, complex problems; but this view is misguided. Though AI has revolutionised aspects of technical medicine, it has brought in its wake practical, conceptual, pedagogical and ethical conundrums. For example, widespread adoption of technologies threatens to shift emphasis from ‘hands‐on’ embodied clinical work to disembodied ‘technology enhanced’ fuzzy scenarios muddying ethical responsibilities. Where AI can offer a powerful sharpening of diagnostic accuracy and treatment options, ‘cold’ technologies and ‘warm’ hands‐on medicine need to walk hand‐in‐hand. This presents a pedagogical challenge grounded in historical precedent: in the wake of Vesalian anatomy introducing the dominant metaphor of ‘body as machine,’ a medicine of qualities was devalued through the rise of instrumental scientific medicine. The AI age in medicine promises to redouble the machine metaphor, reducing complex patient experiences to linear problem‐solving interventions promising ‘solutionism.’ As an instrumental intervention, AI can objectify patients, frustrating the benefits of dialogue, as patients’ complex and often unpredictable fleshly experiences of illness are recalculated in solution‐focused computational terms. Suspicions about solutions The rate of change in numbers and sophistication of new technologies is daunting; they include surgical robotics, implants, computer programming and genetic interventions such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). Contributing to the focus of this issue on ‘solutionism,’ we explore how AI is often promoted as an all‐encompassing answer to complex problems, including the pedagogical, where learning ‘hands‐on’ bedside medicine has proven benefits beyond the technical. Where AI and embodied medicine have differing epistemological, ontological and axiological roots, we must not imagine that they will readily walk hand‐in‐hand down the aisle towards a happy marriage. Their union will be fractious, requiring lifelong guidance provided by a perceptive medical education suspicious of ‘smart’ solutions to complex problems.",https://openalex.org/W3007086729,2020,Anneke G. van der Niet; Alan Bleakley,Maastricht University; University Medical Center Utrecht

Artificial Intelligence Technology Assisted Music Teaching Design,"With the continuous improvement of the global economic level and scientific level, information technology has penetrated into all fields of people’s life. Today, the strategy of vigorously promoting educational modernization has created conditions for intelligent music teaching and promoted the in-depth application of artificial intelligence technology in education. Intelligent instructional design supported by artificial intelligence technology is the deep integration of information technology and music teaching. Through the intelligent perception technology, learning analysis technology, and emotional computing technology of artificial intelligence, an intelligent music teaching model is established. The online learning and education platform based on big data intelligence provides teachers with rich teaching methods, provides personalized evaluation and adaptive learning services for students’ learning, and helps improve the efficiency of music teaching. The traditional teaching design model cannot effectively guide the intelligent music teaching and cannot meet the needs of students’ development. Therefore, on the basis of previous studies, the author studies the intelligent teaching design supported by artificial intelligence technology. This study uses new generation information technologies such as big data, Internet of things, mobile Internet, and artificial intelligence to build a complete set of scientific intelligent music teaching design model. Wisdom teaching provides a reference for the whole process before, during, and after class, helps guide teachers to better carry out wisdom teaching, helps students explore cooperative and autonomous learning, and promotes the wisdom transformation of teaching methods and learning methods to a certain extent. Music classroom teaching has become more targeted and effective.

In artificial intelligence (AI) we trust: A qualitative investigation of AI technology acceptance,"Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are increasingly used to support supply chain management (SCM) activities. However, industry reports and recent research indicate difficulty in implementing AI solutions. This study explores the role of organizational factors in reconciling the differences between the potential SCM benefits of AI and its actual acceptance and use. We apply thematic analysis techniques to explore the marketing materials used by vendors of AI‐enabled software and interviews with organization leaders that have experience with the deployment of AI‐based technologies. The emergent model from our data analysis highlights organizational tactics often used to emphasize AI trustworthiness. Our findings suggest several tactics that could be used to convey that AI is a trustworthy technology. We build on the thematic model to situate the findings as offering theoretical extensions to the “social influence” aspect of UTAUT; and develop a robust call for research related to the effects of AI trustworthiness on internal, upstream, and downstream activities in the supply chain. The results contribute to academic conversations related to the acceptance and use of technology and the growing digitalization of supply chains. We outline managerial implications regarding the role of AI trustworthiness in AI use for managing SCM.",https://openalex.org/W4212814119,2022,Abhinav Hasija; Terry L. Esper,Fisher College

Assessing Artificial Intelligence Technology Acceptance in Managerial Accounting,"The increasing expansion of digital technologies has significantly changed most economic activities and professions. As a result of the scientific and technological revolution 4.0, organizational structures and business models have changed, and new ones have emerged. Consequently, the accounting activities that record operations and provide the necessary information to managers for decision making have faced threats, challenges, and opportunities, which have changed and will change the DNA of managerial accounting, determining a reinventing of it. As a result of the evolution of data collection and processing technologies, managerial accounting activities have become increasingly complex, encompassing increasing volumes of data. Resistance to change, organizational culture, lack of trust, and the high price of technology are the most critical barriers that interfere with adopting artificial intelligence technology in managerial accounting. This study aimed to assess the acceptance of artificial intelligence technology among accountants in Romanian organizations in the context of the modernization and digitization of managerial accounting. This research was quantitative, carried out through a survey based on a questionnaire. In total, 396 specialists in managerial accounting from Romanian organizations filled and returned the questionnaire. Using structural equation modeling, we tested the model of accepting artificial intelligence technology in managerial accounting.

Computational Radiomics System to Decode the Radiographic Phenotype,"Abstract Radiomics aims to quantify phenotypic characteristics on medical imaging through the use of automated algorithms. Radiomic artificial intelligence (AI) technology, either based on engineered hard-coded algorithms or deep learning methods, can be used to develop noninvasive imaging-based biomarkers. However, lack of standardized algorithm definitions and image processing severely hampers reproducibility and comparability of results. To address this issue, we developed PyRadiomics, a flexible open-source platform capable of extracting a large panel of engineered features from medical images. PyRadiomics is implemented in Python and can be used standalone or using 3D Slicer. Here, we discuss the workflow and architecture of PyRadiomics and demonstrate its application in characterizing lung lesions. Source code, documentation, and examples are publicly available at www.radiomics.io. With this platform, we aim to establish a reference standard for radiomic analyses, provide a tested and maintained resource, and to grow the community of radiomic developers addressing critical needs in cancer research.

Automatic food detection in egocentric images using artificial intelligence technology,"Abstract Objective To develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm which can automatically detect food items from images acquired by an egocentric wearable camera for dietary assessment. Design To study human diet and lifestyle, large sets of egocentric images were acquired using a wearable device, called eButton, from free-living individuals. Three thousand nine hundred images containing real-world activities, which formed eButton data set 1, were manually selected from thirty subjects. eButton data set 2 contained 29 515 images acquired from a research participant in a week-long unrestricted recording. They included both food- and non-food-related real-life activities, such as dining at both home and restaurants, cooking, shopping, gardening, housekeeping chores, taking classes, gym exercise, etc. All images in these data sets were classified as food/non-food images based on their tags generated by a convolutional neural network. Results A cross data-set test was conducted on eButton data set 1. The overall accuracy of food detection was 91·5 and 86·4 %, respectively, when one-half of data set 1 was used for training and the other half for testing. For eButton data set 2, 74·0 % sensitivity and 87·0 % specificity were obtained if both ‘food’ and ‘drink’ were considered as food images. Alternatively, if only ‘food’ items were considered, the sensitivity and specificity reached 85·0 and 85·8 %, respectively. Conclusions The AI technology can automatically detect foods from low-quality, wearable camera-acquired real-world egocentric images with reasonable accuracy, reducing both the burden of data processing and privacy concerns.",https://openalex.org/W2794003850,2018,Wenyan Jia; Yuecheng Li; Ruowei Qu,University of Pittsburgh; Hebei University of Technology

Trust Toward Robots and Artificial Intelligence: An Experimental Approach to Human–Technology Interactions Online,"Robotization and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to change societies profoundly. Trust is an important factor of human–technology interactions, as robots and AI increasingly contribute to tasks previously handled by humans. Currently, there is a need for studies investigating trust toward AI and robots, especially in first-encounter meetings. This article reports findings from a study investigating trust toward robots and AI in an online trust game experiment. The trust game manipulated the hypothetical opponents that were described as either AI or robots. These were compared with control group opponents using only a human name or a nickname. Participants ( N = 1077) lived in the United States. Describing opponents with robots or AI did not impact participants’ trust toward them. The robot called jdrx894 was the most trusted opponent. Opponents named “jdrx894” were trusted more than opponents called “Michael.” Further analysis showed that having a degree in technology or engineering, exposure to robots online and robot use self-efficacy predicted higher trust toward robots and AI. Out of Big Five personality characteristics, openness to experience predicted higher trust, and conscientiousness predicted lower trust. Results suggest trust on robots and AI is contextual and it is also dependent on individual differences and knowledge on technology.",https://openalex.org/W3108878059,2020,Atte Oksanen; Nina Savela; Rita Latikka,Tampere University

This book assumes only basic knowledge of algorithms and discrete maths, both of which are taught as standard in the first or second year of computer science degree programmes. A basic knowledge of artificial intelligence would useful to help understand some of the issues, but is not essential. The books main aims are: To introduce the student to the concept of agents and multi-agent systems, and the main applications for which they are appropriate To introduce the main issues surrounding the design of intelligent agents To introduce the main issues surrounding the design of a multi-agent society To introduce a number of typical applications for agent technology",https://openalex.org/W2145790759,2002,Michael Wooldridge,
Innovations in Camera Trapping Technology and Approaches: The Integration of Citizen Science and Artificial Intelligence,"Camera trapping has become an increasingly reliable and mainstream tool for surveying a diversity of wildlife species. Concurrent with this has been an increasing effort to involve the wider public in the research process, in an approach known as ‘citizen science’. To date, millions of people have contributed to research across a wide variety of disciplines as a result. Although their value for public engagement was recognised early on, camera traps were initially ill-suited for citizen science. As camera trap technology has evolved, cameras have become more user-friendly and the enormous quantities of data they now collect has led researchers to seek assistance in classifying footage. This has now made camera trap research a prime candidate for citizen science, as reflected by the large number of camera trap projects now integrating public participation. Researchers are also turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist with classification of footage. Although this rapidly-advancing field is already proving a useful tool, accuracy is variable and AI does not provide the social and engagement benefits associated with citizen science approaches. We propose, as a solution, more efforts to combine citizen science with AI to improve classification accuracy and efficiency while maintaining public involvement.",https://openalex.org/W2999689051,2020,Siân E.

Perceived trust in artificial intelligence technologies: A preliminary study,"Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly prevalent in all spheres of society. Still, the perception of AI from users and customers remains the main barrier for its widespread adoption. Previous studies showed that the acceptance of new technologies in society depends on perceived characteristics. This study examined users’ perception of trust, the difficulty of the task, and application performance when using an AI‐based technology. These factors help us to elucidate the mechanisms for building trust in AI technology from the users’ perspective. A total of 18 participants took part in the experiment with the Google AutoDraw software as an AI tool. As a result, the difficulty of the task, perceived performance, and success/failure of the task can be regarded as the influential factors for the perceived trust evaluation. The perceived trust of users in new AI products would be increased by improving product performance and the successful implementation of the tasks. The obtained results and insights can serve AI product developers to increase the level of users’ trust and attraction towards their technologies and applications.",https://openalex.org/W3010556307,2020,Olga Vl.

"Artificial Intelligence in Education: Awareness, Readiness and Practice of Using Artificial Intelligence Technologies in Professional Activities by University Faculty","Daily artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are being implemented deeper and deeper in all spheres of human life, including education. At the same time, the degree of integration of AI tools into the pedagogical process largely depends on the awareness, readiness and practice of using the entire AI arsenal by teachers in their professional activities. The purpose of this study is to identify the awareness of university faculty in the use of AI tools in teaching activities, as well as to determine the degree of their readiness and practice of using AI technology in the educational process. The survey participants were 426 teachers from 18 universities of the Russian Federation. The results of the survey showed that the integration of AI tools in education is currently at an early stage. In general, university faculty lack a systematic understanding of the organizational, teaching and learning potential of AI tools. Many educators have segmental knowledge, related to a greater extent directly to their professional activities in teaching specific disciplines, and are not able to create a complete picture of the possibilities of AI in education. At the same time, most university professors express a neutral attitude or readiness to use AI tools in teaching activities. The experience of practical application of AI tools in the pedagogical process is limited to a few cases of using specific technologies in teaching specific aspects of disciplines.",https://openalex.org/W4388157911,2023,Pavel V.

An Immersive Context Teaching Method for College English Based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Virtual Reality Technology,"With the development of language research and language teaching, people realize that grammatical competence is an important part of communicative competence. In foreign language teaching, grammar teaching is not only necessary but also the main way to achieve the goal of communicative competence. This article mainly studies the virtual reality technology college English immersive context teaching method based on artificial intelligence and machine learning. The purpose is to improve students’ English learning ability. Through the comparative teaching experiment of two classes of freshmen in a university, the experimental class conducted VR technology-based immersive virtual context teaching from the perspective of constructivism, while the control class adopted common multimedia equipment and traditional teaching methods. In the classroom, teachers occupy most of the time, students only passively receive a lot of information from teachers, they have little chance to participate in the exchange of information and express ideas in the target language, and most of the time they are “immersed” in the Chinese environment. The overall English level was also better than that of the control class, with an average score of 2.8 points higher. This shows that college English immersive context teaching combining constructivism theory and VR technology can indeed improve students’ English level.",https://openalex.org/W3194647138,2021,Ma Li,East China Jiaotong University

What Makes Artificial Intelligence Exceptional in Health Technology Assessment?,"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize the healthcare system, leading to enhance efficiency by automatizing routine tasks and decreasing health-related costs, broadening access to healthcare delivery, targeting more precisely patient needs, and assisting clinicians in their decision-making. For these benefits to materialize, governments and health authorities must regulate AI, and conduct appropriate health technology assessment (HTA). Many authors have highlighted that AI health technologies (AIHT) challenge traditional evaluation and regulatory processes. To inform and support HTA organizations and regulators in adapting their processes to AIHTs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the challenges posed by AIHTs in HTA and health regulation. Our research question was: What makes artificial intelligence exceptional in HTA? The current body of literature appears to portray AIHTs as being exceptional to HTA. This exceptionalism is expressed along 5 dimensions: 1) AIHT’s distinctive features; 2) their systemic impacts on health care and the health sector; 3) the increased expectations towards AI in health; 4) the new ethical, social and legal challenges that arise from deploying AI in the health sector; and 5) the new evaluative constraints that AI poses to HTA. Thus, AIHTs are perceived as exceptional because of their technological characteristics and potential impacts on society at large. As AI implementation by governments and health organizations carries risks of generating new, and amplifying existing, challenges, there are strong arguments for taking into consideration the exceptional aspects of AIHTs, especially as their impacts on the healthcare system will be far greater than that of drugs and medical devices. As AIHTs begin to be increasingly introduced into the health care sector, there is a window of opportunity for HTA agencies and scholars to consider AIHTs’ exceptionalism and to work towards only deploying clinically, economically, socially acceptable AIHTs in the health care system.",https://openalex.org/W3210293336,2021,Jean‐Christophe Bélisle‐Pipon; Vincent Couture; Marie‐Christine Roy,Simon Fraser University; Université Laval; Université de Montréal
