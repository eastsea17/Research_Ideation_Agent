Artificial intelligence-enabled healthcare delivery,"Summary In recent years, there has been massive progress in artificial intelligence (AI) with the development of deep neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision and robotics. These techniques are now actively being applied in healthcare with many of the health service activities currently being delivered by clinicians and administrators predicted to be taken over by AI in the coming years. However, there has also been exceptional hype about the abilities of AI with a mistaken notion that AI will replace human clinicians altogether. These perspectives are inaccurate, and if a balanced perspective of the limitations and promise of AI is taken, one can gauge which parts of the health system AI can be integrated to make a meaningful impact. The four main areas where AI would have the most influence would be: patient administration, clinical decision support, patient monitoring and healthcare interventions. This health system where AI plays a central role could be termed an AI-enabled or AI-augmented health system. In this article, we discuss how this system can be developed based on a realistic assessment of current AI technologies and predicted developments.",https://openalex.org/W2902461656,2018,Sandeep Reddy; John Fox; Maulik Purohit,Deakin University; University of Oxford; The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston

Perceptions of artificial intelligence in healthcare: findings from a qualitative survey study among actors in France,"Abstract Background Artificial intelligence (AI), with its seemingly limitless power, holds the promise to truly revolutionize patient healthcare. However, the discourse carried out in public does not always correlate with the actual impact. Thus, we aimed to obtain both an overview of how French health professionals perceive the arrival of AI in daily practice and the perception of the other actors involved in AI to have an overall understanding of this issue. Methods Forty French stakeholders with diverse backgrounds were interviewed in Paris between October 2017 and June 2018 and their contributions analyzed using the grounded theory method (GTM). Results The interviews showed that the various actors involved all see AI as a myth to be debunked. However, their views differed. French healthcare professionals, who are strategically placed in the adoption of AI tools, were focused on providing the best and safest care for their patients. Contrary to popular belief, they are not always seeing the use of these tools in their practice. For healthcare industrial partners, AI is a true breakthrough but legal difficulties to access individual health data could hamper its development. Institutional players are aware that they will have to play a significant role concerning the regulation of the use of these tools. From an external point of view, individuals without a conflict of interest have significant concerns about the sustainability of the balance between health, social justice, and freedom. Health researchers specialized in AI have a more pragmatic point of view and hope for a better transition from research to practice. Conclusion Although some hyperbole has taken over the discourse on AI in healthcare, diverse opinions and points of view have emerged among French stakeholders. The development of AI tools in healthcare will be satisfactory for everyone only by initiating a collaborative effort between all those involved. It is thus time to also consider the opinion of patients and, together, address the remaining questions, such as that of responsibility.",https://openalex.org/W3000239480,2020,M.

Governing the safety of artificial intelligence in healthcare,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has enormous potential to improve the safety of healthcare, from increasing diagnostic accuracy,1 to optimising treatment planning,2 to forecasting outcomes of care.3 However, integrating AI technologies into the delivery of healthcare is likely to introduce a range of new risks and amplify existing ones. For instance, failures in widely used software have the potential to quickly affect large numbers of patients4; hidden assumptions in underlying data and models can lead to AI systems delivering dangerous recommendations that are insensitive to local care processes,5 6 and opaque AI techniques such as deep learning can make explaining and learning from failure extremely difficult.7 8 To maximise the benefits of AI in healthcare and to build trust among patients and practitioners, it will therefore be essential to robustly govern the risks that AI poses to patient safety.

In a recent review in this journal, Challen and colleagues present an important and timely analysis of some of the key technological risks associated with the application of machine learning in clinical settings.9 Machine learning is a subfield of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that are automatically derived and optimised through exposure to large quantities of exemplar ‘training’ data.10 The outputs of machine learning algorithms are essentially classifications of patterns that provide some sort of prediction—for instance, predicting whether an image shows a malignant melanoma or a benign mole.11 Some of the basic techniques of machine learning have existed for half a century or more, but progress in the field has accelerated rapidly due to advances in the development of ‘deep’ artificial neural networks12 combined with huge increases in computational power and the availability of enormous quantities of data.

Operationalising ethics in artificial intelligence for healthcare: a framework for AI developers,"Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) offers much promise for improving healthcare. However, it runs the looming risk of causing individual and societal harms; for instance, exacerbating inequalities amongst minority groups, or enabling compromises in the confidentiality of patients’ sensitive data. As such, there is an expanding, unmet need for ensuring AI for healthcare is developed in concordance with human values and ethics. Augmenting “principle-based” guidance that highlight adherence to ethical ideals (without necessarily offering translation into actionable practices), we offer a solution-based framework for operationalising ethics in AI for healthcare. Our framework is built from a scoping review of existing solutions of ethical AI guidelines, frameworks and technical solutions to address human values such as self-direction in healthcare. Our view spans the entire length of the AI lifecycle: data management, model development, deployment and monitoring. Our focus in this paper is to collate actionable solutions (whether technical or non-technical in nature), which can be steps that enable and empower developers in their daily practice to ensuring ethical practices in the broader picture. Our framework is intended to be adopted by AI developers, with recommendations that are accessible and driven by the existing literature. We endorse the recognised need for ‘ethical AI checklists’ co-designed with health AI practitioners, which could further operationalise the technical solutions we have collated. Since the risks to health and wellbeing are so large, we believe a proactive approach is necessary for ensuring human values and ethics are appropriately respected in AI for healthcare.",https://openalex.org/W4285799063,2022,Pravik Solanki; John Grundy; Waqar Hussain,Monash University

Artificial intelligence with multi-functional machine learning platform development for better healthcare and precision medicine,"Abstract Precision medicine is one of the recent and powerful developments in medical care, which has the potential to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine, allowing earlier interventions using advanced diagnostics and tailoring better and economically personalized treatments. Identifying the best pathway to personalized and population medicine involves the ability to analyze comprehensive patient information together with broader aspects to monitor and distinguish between sick and relatively healthy people, which will lead to a better understanding of biological indicators that can signal shifts in health. While the complexities of disease at the individual level have made it difficult to utilize healthcare information in clinical decision-making, some of the existing constraints have been greatly minimized by technological advancements. To implement effective precision medicine with enhanced ability to positively impact patient outcomes and provide real-time decision support, it is important to harness the power of electronic health records by integrating disparate data sources and discovering patient-specific patterns of disease progression. Useful analytic tools, technologies, databases, and approaches are required to augment networking and interoperability of clinical, laboratory and public health systems, as well as addressing ethical and social issues related to the privacy and protection of healthcare data with effective balance. Developing multifunctional machine learning platforms for clinical data extraction, aggregation, management and analysis can support clinicians by efficiently stratifying subjects to understand specific scenarios and optimize decision-making. Implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare is a compelling vision that has the potential in leading to the significant improvements for achieving the goals of providing real-time, better personalized and population medicine at lower costs.

In the evolving relationship between humans and AI, trust is the one mechanism that shapes clinicians’ use and adoption of AI. Trust is a psychological mechanism to deal with the uncertainty between what is known and unknown. Several research studies have highlighted the need for improving AI-based systems and enhancing their capabilities to help clinicians. However, assessing the magnitude and impact of human trust on AI technology demands substantial attention. Will a clinician trust an AI-based system? What are the factors that influence human trust in AI? Can trust in AI be optimized to improve decision-making processes? In this paper, we focus on clinicians as the primary users of AI systems in health care and present factors shaping trust between clinicians and AI. We highlight critical challenges related to trust that should be considered during the development of any AI system for clinical use.",https://openalex.org/W3036458852,2020,Onur Asan; Alparslan Emrah Bayrak; Avishek Choudhury,Stevens Institute of Technology
Privacy Protection in Using Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare: Chinese Regulation in Comparative Perspective,"Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are now widely employed in China’s medical and healthcare fields. Enormous amounts of personal data are collected from various sources and inserted into AI algorithms for medical purposes, producing challenges to patient’s privacy. This is a comparative study of Chinese, United States, and European Union operational rules for healthcare data that is collected and then used in AI functions, particularly focusing on legal differences and deficiencies. The conceptual boundaries of privacy and personal information, the influence of technological development on the informed consent model, and conflicts between freedom and security in rules of cross-border data flow were found to be key issues requiring consideration when regulating healthcare data used for AI purposes. Furthermore, the results indicate that the appropriate balance between privacy protections and technological development, between individual and group interests, and between corporate profits and the public interest should be identified and observed. In terms of specific rule-making, it was found that China should establish special regulations protecting healthcare information, provide clear definitions and classification schemas for different types of healthcare information, and enact stricter accountability mechanisms. Examining and contrasting operational rules for AI in health care promotes informed privacy governance and improved privacy legislation.",https://openalex.org/W4297539945,2022,Chao Wang; Jieyu Zhang; Nicholas Lassi,Zhejiang University
Influential Usage of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is making computer systems capable of executing human brain tasks in many fields in all aspects of daily life. The enhancement in information and communications technology (ICT) has indisputably improved the quality of people’s lives around the globe. Especially, ICT has led to a very needy and tremendous improvement in the health sector which is commonly known as electronic health (eHealth) and medical health (mHealth). Deep machine learning and AI approaches are commonly presented in many applications using big data, which consists of all relevant data about the medical health and diseases which a model can access at the time of execution or diagnosis of diseases. For example, cardiovascular imaging has now accurate imaging combined with big data from the eHealth record and pathology to better characterize the disease and personalized therapy. In clinical work and imaging, cancer care is getting improved by knowing the tumor biology and helping in the implementation of precision medicine. The Markov model is used to extract new approaches for leveraging cancer. In this paper, we have reviewed existing research relevant to eHealth and mHealth where various models are discussed which uses big data for the diagnosis and healthcare system.

Reporting guidelines for artificial intelligence in healthcare research,"Abstract Reporting guidelines are structured tools developed using explicit methodology that specify the minimum information required by researchers when reporting a study. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) reporting guidelines that address potential sources of bias specific to studies involving AI interventions has the potential to improve the quality of AI studies, through improvements in their design and delivery, and the completeness and transparency of their reporting. With a number of guidance documents relating to AI studies emerging from different specialist societies, this Review article provides researchers with some key principles for selecting the most appropriate reporting guidelines for a study involving an AI intervention. As the main determinants of a high‐quality study are contained within the methodology of the study design rather than the intervention, researchers are recommended to use reporting guidelines that are specific to the study design, and then supplement them with AI‐specific guidance contained within available AI reporting guidelines.",https://openalex.org/W3158319314,2021,Hussein Ibrahim; Xiaoxuan Liu; Alastair K.

Western Australian medical students’ attitudes towards artificial intelligence in healthcare,"Introduction Surveys conducted internationally have found widespread interest in artificial intelligence (AI) amongst medical students. No similar surveys have been conducted in Western Australia (WA) and it is not known how medical students in WA feel about the use of AI in healthcare or their understanding of AI. We aim to assess WA medical students’ attitudes towards AI in general, AI in healthcare, and the inclusion of AI education in the medical curriculum. Methods A digital survey instrument was developed based on a review of available literature and consultation with subject matter experts. The survey was piloted with a group of medical students and refined based on their feedback. We then sent this anonymous digital survey to all medical students in WA (approximately 1539 students). Responses were open from the 7 th of September 2021 to the 7 th of November 2021. Students’ categorical responses were qualitatively analysed, and free text comments from the survey were qualitatively analysed using open coding techniques. Results Overall, 134 students answered one or more questions (8.9% response rate). The majority of students (82.0%) were 20–29 years old, studying medicine as a postgraduate degree (77.6%), and had started clinical rotations (62.7%). Students were interested in AI (82.6%), self-reported having a basic understanding of AI (84.8%), but few agreed that they had an understanding of the basic computational principles of AI (33.3%) or the limitations of AI (46.2%). Most students (87.5%) had not received teaching in AI. The majority of students (58.6%) agreed that AI should be part of medical training and most (72.7%) wanted more teaching focusing on AI in medicine. Medical students appeared optimistic regarding the role of AI in medicine, with most (74.4%) agreeing with the statement that AI will improve medicine in general. The majority (56.6%) of medical students were not concerned about the impact of AI on their job security as a doctor. Students selected radiology (72.6%), pathology (58.2%), and medical administration (44.8%) as the specialties most likely to be impacted by AI, and psychiatry (61.2%), palliative care (48.5%), and obstetrics and gynaecology (41.0%) as the specialties least likely to be impacted by AI. Qualitative analysis of free text comments identified the use of AI as a tool, and that doctors will not be replaced as common themes. Conclusion Medical students in WA appear to be interested in AI. However, they have not received education about AI and do not feel they understand its basic computational principles or limitations. AI appears to be a current deficit in the medical curriculum in WA, and most students surveyed were supportive of its introduction. These results are consistent with previous surveys conducted internationally.",https://openalex.org/W4386323538,2023,Jonathon Stewart; Juan Lü; Nestor Gahungu,Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research; The University of Western Australia; Fiona Stanley Hospital
Acceptability of artificial intelligence (AI)-led chatbot services in healthcare: A mixed-methods study,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants’ willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results Three broad themes: ‘Understanding of chatbots’, ‘AI hesitancy’ and ‘Motivations for health chatbots’ were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI 95% :0.13–0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI 95% :0.60–0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI 95% :3.08–8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI 95% :1.77–4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI 95% :1.13–3.25]. Conclusion Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients’ concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients’ perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots.",https://openalex.org/W2969468266,2019,Tom Nadarzynski; Oliver Miles; Aimee Cowie,University of Westminster; University College London; University of Southampton

Artificial intelligence in healthcare robots: A social informatics study of knowledge embodiment,"Knowledge embodiment, taking a social informatics perspective, refers to the transformation of knowledge into a form in which its value becomes evident. Knowledge embodiment in robotic systems with artificial intelligence (AI robotic systems) actualizes the value of knowledge much more powerfully than other entities, potentially altering the connections among people or even displacing professionals. To understand the effects of knowledge embodiment in AI robotic systems on connections among people and technology, this study addresses 2 cumulative research questions: (i) What is the nature of knowledge embodiment, that is, how are knowledge and AI robots assembled for knowledge work? (ii) How does knowledge embodiment affect connections among people and technology (that is, social informatics)? A case study of a large hospital that has employed different AI robotic systems in many parts of its healthcare service provision process indicates 4 forms of knowledge embodiment, each with a distinct focus. Further, a social informatics analysis suggests four ways knowledge embodiment affects connections among people and technology and reveals related social and institutional issues that go beyond technological determinism. Implications of these findings for research on social informatics and information science are discussed.",https://openalex.org/W2907512083,2018,Loo Geok Pee; Shan L.

Artificial intelligence (AI) healthcare technology innovations: the current state and challenges from a life science industry perspective,"The purpose of this study is to assess innovation system performance and identify the system-blocking mechanisms for AI healthcare technology innovations related to the life science industry. The socio-technical analytical framework Technological innovation systems (TIS) was used to assess the structural and functional dynamics of AI healthcare technology innovations related to the life science industry in West Sweden. The case study employs a mixed-method research approach, triangulating qualitative and quantitative data from secondary published sources and interviews with 21 experts and 25 life science business executives. The results reveal that innovation system performance is primarily restricted by the system weaknesses of limited resources and insufficient communication from leading healthcare professionals regarding their needs for improving healthcare using AI technology innovations. This study shows that to improve innovation system performance, policy interventions intended to increase available resources and to formulate vision and mission statements to improve healthcare with AI technology innovations may be encouraged. This study contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms and interdependencies between system functions using the socio-technical TIS framework in a healthcare context.",https://openalex.org/W3201541319,2021,Petra Apell; Henrik Eriksson,Chalmers University of Technology
Student perspectives on the integration of artificial intelligence into healthcare services,"Background Healthcare workers are often overworked, underfunded, and face many challenges. Integration of artificial intelligence into healthcare service provision can tackle these challenges by relieving burdens on healthcare workers. Since healthcare students are our future healthcare workers, we assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and perspectives of current healthcare students at Qatar University on the implementation of artificial intelligence into healthcare services. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of QU-Health Cluster students via an online survey over a three-week period in November 2021. Chi-squared tests and gamma coefficients were used to compare differences between categorical variables. Results One hundred and ninety-three QU-Health students responded. Most participants had a positive attitude towards artificial intelligence, finding it useful and reliable. The most popular perceived advantage of artificial intelligence was its ability to speed up work processes. Around 40% expressed concern about a threat to job security from artificial intelligence, and a majority believed that artificial intelligence cannot provide sympathetic care (57.9%). Participants who felt that artificial intelligence can better make diagnoses than humans also agreed that artificial intelligence could replace their job (p = 0.005). Male students had more knowledge (p = 0.005) and received more training (p = 0.005) about healthcare artificial intelligence. Participants cited a lack of expert mentorship as a barrier to obtaining knowledge about artificial intelligence, followed by lack of dedicated courses and funding. Conclusions More resources are required for students to develop a good understanding about artificial intelligence. Education needs to be supported by expert mentorship. Further work is needed on how best to integrate artificial intelligence teaching into university curricula.",https://openalex.org/W4379057663,2023,Muna N Ahmad; Saja A Abdallah; Saddam Akber Abbasi,Qatar University; University of Birmingham
An Open Science Approach to Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare,"Objectives: Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers significant potential for improving healthcare. This paper discusses how an “open science” approach to AI tool development, data sharing, education, and research can support the clinical adoption of AI systems. Method: In response to the call for participation for the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on AI in healthcare, the IMIA Open Source Working Group conducted a rapid review of recent literature relating to open science and AI in healthcare and discussed how an open science approach could help overcome concerns about the adoption of new AI technology in healthcare settings. Results: The recent literature reveals that open science approaches to AI system development are well established. The ecosystem of software development, data sharing, education, and research in the AI community has, in general, adopted an open science ethos that has driven much of the recent innovation and adoption of new AI techniques. However, within the healthcare domain, adoption may be inhibited by the use of “black-box” AI systems, where only the inputs and outputs of those systems are understood, and clinical effectiveness and implementation studies are missing. Conclusions: As AI-based data analysis and clinical decision support systems begin to be implemented in healthcare systems around the world, further openness of clinical effectiveness and mechanisms of action may be required by safety-conscious healthcare policy-makers to ensure they are clinically effective in real world use.",https://openalex.org/W2940709043,2019,Chris Paton; Shinji Kobayashi,University of Oxford; Open Source Drug Discovery; Kyoto University

A framework for examining patient attitudes regarding applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare,"Background While use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is increasing, little is known about how patients view healthcare AI. Characterizing patient attitudes and beliefs about healthcare AI and the factors that lead to these attitudes can help ensure patient values are in close alignment with the implementation of these new technologies. Methods We conducted 15 focus groups with adult patients who had a recent primary care visit at a large academic health center. Using modified grounded theory, focus-group data was analyzed for themes related to the formation of attitudes and beliefs about healthcare AI. Results When evaluating AI in healthcare, we found that patients draw on a variety of factors to contextualize these new technologies including previous experiences of illness, interactions with health systems and established health technologies, comfort with other information technology, and other personal experiences. We found that these experiences informed normative and cultural beliefs about the values and goals of healthcare technologies that patients applied when engaging with AI. The results of this study form the basis for a theoretical framework for understanding patient orientation to applications of AI in healthcare, highlighting a number of specific social, health, and technological experiences that will likely shape patient opinions about future healthcare AI applications. Conclusions Understanding the basis of patient attitudes and beliefs about healthcare AI is a crucial first step in effective patient engagement and education. The theoretical framework we present provides a foundation for future studies examining patient opinions about applications of AI in healthcare.",https://openalex.org/W4220954134,2022,Jordan Richardson; Susan Curtis; Cambray Smith,Mayo Clinic in Florida

Review of study reporting guidelines for clinical studies using artificial intelligence in healthcare,"High-quality research is essential in guiding evidence-based care, and should be reported in a way that is reproducible, transparent and where appropriate, provide sufficient detail for inclusion in future meta-analyses. Reporting guidelines for various study designs have been widely used for clinical (and preclinical) studies, consisting of checklists with a minimum set of points for inclusion. With the recent rise in volume of research using artificial intelligence (AI), additional factors need to be evaluated, which do not neatly conform to traditional reporting guidelines (eg, details relating to technical algorithm development). In this review, reporting guidelines are highlighted to promote awareness of essential content required for studies evaluating AI interventions in healthcare. These include published and in progress extensions to well-known reporting guidelines such as Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-AI (study protocols), Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-AI (randomised controlled trials), Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-AI (diagnostic accuracy studies) and Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis-AI (prediction model studies). Additionally there are a number of guidelines that consider AI for health interventions more generally (eg, Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM), minimum information (MI)-CLAIM, MI for Medical AI Reporting) or address a specific element such as the ‘learning curve’ (Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigation of Decision-AI) . Economic evaluation of AI health interventions is not currently addressed, and may benefit from extension to an existing guideline. In the face of a rapid influx of studies of AI health interventions, reporting guidelines help ensure that investigators and those appraising studies consider both the well-recognised elements of good study design and reporting, while also adequately addressing new challenges posed by AI-specific elements.",https://openalex.org/W3196173279,2021,Susan C.

Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: A New Technology Benefit for Both Patients and Doctors,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is arguably the most exciting robotics industry and it is recently emerging in healthcare. Most of the researches have been focusing on prediction algorithms of patients' diseases such as cancer, cardiology, breast pathology, etc. Some findings increased computer intelligence as the main application of AI which called deep or non-deep machine learning. The gap from previous models is using one function or one type of AI to analyze, forecast diseases rather than helping patients and doctors in surgery. There are rarely white papers using AI for patients approach to training them to know more about their diseases or surgery. Therefore, with developing of more than one function of AI, the paper builds a diagrammatic conceptual model of artificial intelligence on medical app running Blockchain technology as a friendly assistant for both patients and doctors to communicate them during pre-surgery, surgery and post-surgery. First, AI as an assistant checks free appointment from doctors and patients' available time. Second, AI reminds doctors' schedule of upcoming surgery list and training patients before taking surgery. Third, deep learning AI analyses patients' healthcare record and suggesting the solutions for patients after surgery under the doctor's review. This paper hopefully will contribute to AI application in healthcare in which not only doctors using it but also patients, drug companies, insurance companies and hospitals can approach.",https://openalex.org/W2983648144,2019,Tran Le Nguyen; Thi Thu Ha,University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City
Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare,"Now in these days, artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a major role in healthcare. It has many applications in diagnosis, robotic surgeries, and research, powered by the growing availability of healthcare facts and brisk improvement of analytical techniques. AI is launched in such a way that it has similar knowledge as a human but is more efficient. A robot has the same expertise as a surgeon; even if it takes a longer time for surgery, its sutures, precision, and uniformity are far better than the surgeon, leading to fewer chances of failure. To make all these things possible, AI needs some sets of algorithms. In Artificial Intelligence, there are two key categories: machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NPL), both of which are necessary to achieve practically any aim in healthcare. The goal of this study is to keep track of current advancements in science, understand technological availability, recognize the enormous power of AI in healthcare, and encourage scientists to use AI in their related fields of research.

Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare Simulation: The Shifting Landscape of Medical Education,"The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) will be felt not only in the arena of patient care and deliverable therapies but will also be uniquely disruptive in medical education and healthcare simulation (HCS), in particular. As HCS is intertwined with computer technology, it offers opportunities for rapid scalability with AI and, therefore, will be the most practical place to test new AI applications. This will ensure the acquisition of AI literacy for graduates from the country's various healthcare professional schools. Artificial intelligence has proven to be a useful adjunct in developing interprofessional education and team and leadership skills assessments. Outcome-driven medical simulation has been extensively used to train students in image-centric disciplines such as radiology, ultrasound, echocardiography, and pathology. Allowing students and trainees in healthcare to first apply diagnostic decision support systems (DDSS) under simulated conditions leads to improved diagnostic accuracy, enhanced communication with patients, safer triage decisions, and improved outcomes from rapid response teams. However, the issue of bias, hallucinations, and the uncertainty of emergent properties may undermine the faith of healthcare professionals as they see AI systems deployed in the clinical setting and participating in diagnostic judgments. Also, the demands of ensuring AI literacy in our healthcare professional curricula will place burdens on simulation assets and faculty to adapt to a rapidly changing technological landscape. Nevertheless, the introduction of AI will place increased emphasis on virtual reality platforms, thereby improving the availability of self-directed learning and making it available 24/7, along with uniquely personalized evaluations and customized coaching. Yet, caution must be exercised concerning AI, especially as society's earlier, delayed, and muted responses to the inherent dangers of social media raise serious questions about whether the American government and its citizenry can anticipate the security and privacy guardrails that need to be in place to protect our healthcare practitioners, medical students, and patients.",https://openalex.org/W4396667204,2024,Allan J.

Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare Regulatory and Legal Concerns,"We are in a stage of transition as artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare across the world. Transitions offer opportunities compounded with difficulties. It is universally accepted that regulations and the law can never keep up with the exponential growth of technology. This paper discusses liability issues when AI is deployed in healthcare. Ever-changing, futuristic, user friendly, uncomplicated regulatory requirements promoting compliance and adherence are needed. Regulators have to understand that software itself could be a software as a medical device (SaMD). Benefits of AI could be delayed if slow, expensive clinical trials are mandated. Regulations should distinguish between diagnostic errors, malfunction of technology, or errors due to initial use of inaccurate/inappropriate data as training data sets. The sharing of responsibility and accountability when implementation of an AI-based recommendation causes clinical problems is not clear. Legislation is necessary to allow apportionment of damages consequent to malfunction of an AI-enabled system. Product liability is ascribed to defective equipment and medical devices. However, Watson, the AI-enabled supercomputer, is treated as a consulting physician and not categorised as a product. In India, algorithms cannot be patented. There are no specific laws enacted to deal with AI in healthcare. DISHA or the Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act when implemented in India would hopefully cover some issues. Ultimately, the law is interpreted contextually and perceptions could be different among patients, clinicians and the legal system.

Public perceptions of artificial intelligence in healthcare: ethical concerns and opportunities for patient-centered care,"Abstract Background In an effort to improve the quality of medical care, the philosophy of patient-centered care has become integrated into almost every aspect of the medical community. Despite its widespread acceptance, among patients and practitioners, there are concerns that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence may threaten elements of patient-centered care, such as personal relationships with care providers and patient-driven choices. This study explores the extent to which patients are confident in and comfortable with the use of these technologies when it comes to their own individual care and identifies areas that may align with or threaten elements of patient-centered care. Methods An exploratory, mixed-method approach was used to analyze survey data from 600 US-based adults in the State of Florida. The survey was administered through a leading market research provider (August 10–21, 2023), and responses were collected to be representative of the state’s population based on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Results Respondents were more comfortable with the use of AI in health-related tasks that were not associated with doctor-patient relationships, such as scheduling patient appointments or follow-ups (84.2%). Fear of losing the ‘human touch’ associated with doctors was a common theme within qualitative coding, suggesting a potential conflict between the implementation of AI and patient-centered care. In addition, decision self-efficacy was associated with higher levels of comfort with AI, but there were also concerns about losing decision-making control, workforce changes, and cost concerns. A small majority of participants mentioned that AI could be useful for doctors and lead to more equitable care but only when used within limits.

Implementing the human right to science in the regulatory governance of artificial intelligence in healthcare,"Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) enables a medical device to optimize its performance through machine learning (ML), including the ability to learn from past experiences. In healthcare, ML is currently applied within controlled settings in devices to diagnose conditions like diabetic retinopathy without clinician input, for instance. In order to allow AI-based medical devices (AIMDs) to adapt actively to its data environment through ML, the current risk-based regulatory approaches are inadequate in facilitating this technological progression. Recent and innovative regulatory changes introduced to regulate AIMDs as a software, or ‘software as a medical device’ (SaMD), and the adoption of a total device/product-specific lifecycle approach (rather than one that is point-in-time) reflect a shift away from the strictly risk-based approach to one that is more collaborative and participatory in nature, and anticipatory in character. These features are better explained by a rights-based approach and consistent with the human right to science (HRS). With reference to the recent explication of the normative content of HRS by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of the United Nations, this paper explains why a rights-based approach that is centred on HRS could be a more effective response to the regulatory challenges posed by AIMDs. The paper also considers how such a rights-based approach could be implemented in the form of a regulatory network that draws on a ‘common fund of knowledges’ to formulate anticipatory responses to adaptive AIMDs. In essence, the HRS provides both the mandate and the obligation for states to ensure that regulatory governance of high connectivity AIMDs become increasingly collaborative and participatory in approach and pluralistic in substance.",https://openalex.org/W4387731794,2023,Calvin Wai-Loon Ho,University of Hong Kong

Sources of bias in artificial intelligence that perpetuate healthcare disparities—A global review,"Background While artificial intelligence (AI) offers possibilities of advanced clinical prediction and decision-making in healthcare, models trained on relatively homogeneous datasets, and populations poorly-representative of underlying diversity, limits generalisability and risks biased AI-based decisions. Here, we describe the landscape of AI in clinical medicine to delineate population and data-source disparities. Methods We performed a scoping review of clinical papers published in PubMed in 2019 using AI techniques. We assessed differences in dataset country source, clinical specialty, and author nationality, sex, and expertise. A manually tagged subsample of PubMed articles was used to train a model, leveraging transfer-learning techniques (building upon an existing BioBERT model) to predict eligibility for inclusion (original, human, clinical AI literature). Of all eligible articles, database country source and clinical specialty were manually labelled. A BioBERT-based model predicted first/last author expertise. Author nationality was determined using corresponding affiliated institution information using Entrez Direct. And first/last author sex was evaluated using the Gendarize.io API. Results Our search yielded 30,576 articles, of which 7,314 (23.9%) were eligible for further analysis. Most databases came from the US (40.8%) and China (13.7%). Radiology was the most represented clinical specialty (40.4%), followed by pathology (9.1%). Authors were primarily from either China (24.0%) or the US (18.4%). First and last authors were predominately data experts (i.e., statisticians) (59.6% and 53.9% respectively) rather than clinicians. And the majority of first/last authors were male (74.1%). Interpretation U.S. and Chinese datasets and authors were disproportionately overrepresented in clinical AI, and almost all of the top 10 databases and author nationalities were from high income countries (HICs). AI techniques were most commonly employed for image-rich specialties, and authors were predominantly male, with non-clinical backgrounds. Development of technological infrastructure in data-poor regions, and diligence in external validation and model re-calibration prior to clinical implementation in the short-term, are crucial in ensuring clinical AI is meaningful for broader populations, and to avoid perpetuating global health inequity.",https://openalex.org/W4220839569,2022,Leo Anthony Celi; Jacqueline Cellini; Marie‐Laure Charpignon,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Moral exemplars for the virtuous machine: the clinician’s role in ethical artificial intelligence for healthcare,"Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to pervade several aspects of healthcare with pace and scale. The need for an ethical framework in AI to address this has long been recognized, but to date most efforts have delivered only high-level principles and value statements. Herein, we explain the need for an ethical framework in healthcare AI, the different moral theories that may serve as its basis, the rationale for why we believe this should be built around virtue ethics, and explore this in the context of five key ethical concerns for the introduction of AI in healthcare. Some existing work has suggested that AI may replace clinicians. We argue to the contrary, that the clinician will not be replaced, nor their role attenuated. Rather, they will be integral to the responsible design, deployment, and regulation of AI in healthcare, acting as the moral exemplar for the virtuous machine. We collate relevant points from the literature and formulate our own to present a coherent argument for the central role of clinicians in ethical AI and propose ideas to help advance efforts to employ ML-based solutions within healthcare. Finally, we highlight the responsibility of not only clinicians, but also data scientists, tech companies, ethicists, and regulators to act virtuously in realising the vision of ethical and accountable AI in healthcare.",https://openalex.org/W3200883555,2021,Sumeet Hindocha; Cosmin Badea,Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust; Imperial College London

The FUTURE-AI consortium was founded in 2021 and currently comprises 118 inter-disciplinary experts from 51 countries representing all continents, including AI scientists, clinicians, ethicists, and social scientists. Over a two-year period, the consortium defined guiding principles and best practices for trustworthy AI through an iterative process comprising an in-depth literature review, a modified Delphi survey, and online consensus meetings. The FUTURE-AI framework was established based on 6 guiding principles for trustworthy AI in healthcare, i.e. Fairness, Universality, Traceability, Usability, Robustness and Explainability. Through consensus, a set of 28 best practices were defined, addressing technical, clinical, legal and socio-ethical dimensions. The recommendations cover the entire lifecycle of medical AI, from design, development and validation to regulation, deployment, and monitoring. FUTURE-AI is a risk-informed, assumption-free guideline which provides a structured approach for constructing medical AI tools that will be trusted, deployed and adopted in real-world practice. Researchers are encouraged to take the recommendations into account in proof-of-concept stages to facilitate future translation towards clinical practice of medical AI.",https://openalex.org/W4387030598,2023,Karim Lekadir; Aasa Feragen; Abdul Joseph Fofanah,
Integrating artificial intelligence into healthcare systems: more than just the algorithm,"Boussina et al. recently evaluated a deep learning sepsis prediction model (COMPOSER) in a prospective before-and-after quasi-experimental study within two emergency departments at UC San Diego Health, tracking outcomes before and after deployment. Over the five-month implementation period, they reported a 17% relative reduction in in-hospital sepsis mortality and a 10% relative increase in sepsis bundle compliance. This editorial discusses the importance of shifting the focus towards evaluating clinically relevant outcomes, such as mortality reduction or quality-of-life improvements, when adopting artificial intelligence (AI) tools. We also explore the ecosystem vital for AI algorithms to succeed in the clinical setting, from interoperability standards and infrastructure to dashboards and action plans. Finally, we suggest that algorithms may eventually fail due to the human nature of healthcare, advocating for the need for continuous monitoring systems to ensure the adaptability of these tools in the ever-evolving healthcare landscape.",https://openalex.org/W4392386827,2024,Jethro C.

For a critical appraisal of artificial intelligence in healthcare: The problem of bias in <scp>mHealth</scp>,"Abstract Rationale, aims and objectives Artificial intelligence and big data are more and more used in medicine, either in prevention, diagnosis or treatment, and are clearly modifying the way medicine is thought and practiced. Some authors argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze big data would even constitute a scientific revolution, in medicine as much as in other scientific disciplines. Moreover, artificial intelligence techniques, coupled with mobile health technologies, could furnish a personalized medicine, adapted to the individuality of each patient. In this paper we argue that this conception is largely a myth: what health professionals and patients need is not more data, but data that are critically appraised, especially to avoid bias. Methods In this historical and conceptual article, we focus on two main problems: first, the data and the problem of its validity; second, the inference drawn from the data by AI, and the establishment of correlations through the use of algorithms. We use examples from the contemporary use of mobile health (mHealth), i.e. the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile or wearable devices such as mobile phones or smart watches. Results We show that the validity of the data and of the inferences drawn from these mHealth data are likely to be biased. As biases are insensitive to the size of the sample, even if the sample is the whole population, artificial intelligence and big data cannot avoid biases and even tend to increase them. Conclusions The large amount of data thus appears rather as a problem than a solution. What contemporary medicine needs is not more data or more algorithms, but a critical appraisal of the data and of the analysis of the data. Considering the history of epidemiology, we propose three research priorities concerning the use of artificial intelligence and big data in medicine.",https://openalex.org/W3117260919,2020,Nicolas Brault; Mohit Saxena,Institut Supérieur des Biotechnologies de Paris

The ethics of advancing artificial intelligence in healthcare: analyzing ethical considerations for Japan’s innovative AI hospital system,"Public and private investments into developing digital health technologies—including artificial intelligence (AI)—are intensifying globally. Japan is a key case study given major governmental investments, in part through a Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP) for an “Innovative AI Hospital System.” Yet, there has been little critical examination of the SIP Research Plan, particularly from an ethics approach. This paper reports on an analysis of the Plan to identify the extent to which it addressed ethical considerations set out in the World Health Organization’s 2021 Guidance on the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence for Health. A coding framework was created based on the six ethical principles proposed in the Guidance and was used as the basis for a content analysis. 101 references to aspects of the framework were identified in the Plan, but attention to the ethical principles was found to be uneven, ranging from the strongest focus on the potential benefits of AI to healthcare professionals and patients ( n = 44; Principle 2), to no consideration of the need for responsive or sustainable AI ( n = 0; Principle 6). Ultimately, the findings show that the Plan reflects insufficient consideration of the ethical issues that arise from developing and implementing AI for healthcare purposes. This case study is used to argue that, given the ethical complexity of the use of digital health technologies, consideration of the full range of ethical concerns put forward by the WHO must urgently be made visible in future plans for AI in healthcare.",https://openalex.org/W4384497585,2023,Amelia Katirai,The University of Osaka

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts and Challenges in Healthcare,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. Examples of AI techniques are machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. AI can be applied in many different areas, such as econometrics, biometry, e-commerce, and the automotive industry. In recent years, AI has found its way into healthcare as well, helping doctors make better decisions (“clinical decision support”), localizing tumors in magnetic resonance images, reading and analyzing reports written by radiologists and pathologists, and much more. However, AI has one big risk: it can be perceived as a “black box”, limiting trust in its reliability, which is a very big issue in an area in which a decision can mean life or death. As a result, the term Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been gaining momentum. XAI tries to ensure that AI algorithms (and the resulting decisions) can be understood by humans. In this narrative review, we will have a look at some central concepts in XAI, describe several challenges around XAI in healthcare, and discuss whether it can really help healthcare to advance, for example, by increasing understanding and trust. Finally, alternatives to increase trust in AI are discussed, as well as future research possibilities in the area of XAI.",https://openalex.org/W4385766743,2023,Tim Hulsen,Philips (Netherlands)
Artificial intelligence in sepsis early prediction and diagnosis using unstructured data in healthcare,"Abstract Sepsis is a leading cause of death in hospitals. Early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis, which is critical in reducing mortality, is challenging as many of its signs and symptoms are similar to other less critical conditions. We develop an artificial intelligence algorithm, SERA algorithm, which uses both structured data and unstructured clinical notes to predict and diagnose sepsis. We test this algorithm with independent, clinical notes and achieve high predictive accuracy 12 hours before the onset of sepsis (AUC 0.94, sensitivity 0.87 and specificity 0.87). We compare the SERA algorithm against physician predictions and show the algorithm’s potential to increase the early detection of sepsis by up to 32% and reduce false positives by up to 17%. Mining unstructured clinical notes is shown to improve the algorithm’s accuracy compared to using only clinical measures for early warning 12 to 48 hours before the onset of sepsis.",https://openalex.org/W3124926562,2021,Kim Huat Goh; Le Wang; Adrian Yeow,Nanyang Technological University; Singapore University of Social Sciences
