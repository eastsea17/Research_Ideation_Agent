Dynamics of aluminum combustion,"A study has been performed modeling both steady and unsteady combustion of aluminum. Law's steadystate aluminum combustion model has been expanded to include the effects of multiple oxidizers and their products, oxide accumulation on the surface of the burning aluminum particle, and convection. Both transport and thermodynamic properties are calculated internally for varying temperatures, relaxing the normal assumption of unity Lewis number. The aluminum combustion model has been compared to experimental data from burners, laser-ignited particles, and propellant under a variety of conditions, showing a reasonable degree of agreement. Calculations with the model show that O2 is a stronger oxidizer than H2O, which in turn is stronger than CO2. The aluminum combustion model was incorporated into a computer model for predicting acoustic effects in a Rijke burner. Calculations have shown that a significant part of the increase in acousticgrowth due to the addition of aluminum is due strictly to the change in the gas temperature profile. The change in temperature profile apparently causes the location of the velocity antinode to shift relative to the Rijke burner flame and thereby cause an increase in the flame response. The acoustic model agrees reasonably well with available acoustic growth rates for data where aluminum particles have been added to a propane Rijke burner.

Biotite is stable over the entire temperature interval, although it reacts progressively to hercynite + melt at the high end of the temperature range. Muscovite that survives initial melting breaks down to corundum + orthoclase between 700 and 725 °C. Minor corundum and aluminum silicate are present at 650 °C, whereas corundum with a large sapphire (Fe + Ti) component is present at and above 700 °C. Finally, corundum and hercynite exist with orthoclase-rich feldspar and remaining biotite at 750 °C. The normative composition of melt at the minimum is approximately Ab30Or15Ms20QtZ35 (in weight percent) without other minor components (e.g., cryolite). Both muscovite and its equivalent orthoclase + corundum assemblage contribute substantial excess Al to melt, bringing the value of the Al saturation index (ASI) of melt to 1.4. Li, Rb, Cs, and F are strongly enriched in melts because of the continuous reaction and reequilibration of biotite and muscovite over the temperature interval. Concentrations of the femic components (TiO2 + FeO + MgO + MnO) are low (<1 wt%) but rise with temperature primarily because of increasing solubilities of FeO in melt. Calculated partition coefficients, D(M)Bt/gl, between biotite (Bt) and glass (gl) for the element M show that D(Li)Bt/gl (1.7−1.0), D(Ba)Bt/gl (~14−6), and D(F)Bt/gl (2.5–1.5) all decrease with increasing temperature, whereas partition coefficients for Sr (≈0.04), Rb (≈2.0), and Cs (≈0.4) remain constant with temperature over a large range of concentrations. Partition coefficients for muscovite (Ms) were also determined at 650 °C; D(M)Ms/gl ≈ 0.8 (Li), 3−6 (Ba), 1.6 (Rb), 0.05 (Sr), 0.3 (Cs), and 1.8 (F). These results, together with other data for feldspar, suggest that Rb, Cs, and Ba become strongly fractionated from one another during anatexis of aluminous metasediments and the ensuing crystallization of melts. Finally, the low partition coefficients for F between micas (biotite or muscovite) and melt indicate that F-rich melts can be generated by the incipient hydrous anatexis of aluminous metasediments; models that invoke remelting of a dehydrated protolith to generate such F-rich melts may not be necessary.

First-Principles Molecular Dynamics Simulations of H<sub>2</sub>O on α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(0001),"We present a more detailed account of our recently reported [Hass, K. C.; Schneider, W. F.; Curioni, A.; Andreoni, W. Science 1998, 282, 265] first-principles molecular dynamics investigation of the static and dynamical behavior of adsorbed H2O on α-Al2O3 (0001). Al-terminated surfaces with varying degrees of H2O coverage are modeled using large periodic supercells. A predicted large relaxation of the clean surface agrees well with previous density functional theory calculations. Both molecular and dissociative H2O adsorption modes are identified, with the latter favored by ∼10 kcal mol-1. Complementary Al8O12 cluster results are shown to be unreliable because of their finite lateral extent. Constrained dynamical calculations of free-energy barriers indicate that the dissociation rate is very high, even in the absence of defects, but differs by 3 orders of magnitude for two equally exothermic pathways (proton transfer being more favorable across a six-membered ring than to the nearest O site). Unconstrained simulations at intermediate H2O coverages exhibit (1) spontaneous unimolecular and (2) H2O-mediated dissociation events, as well as (3) the diffusion and hydrogen bonding of physisorbed H2O and (4) an additional proton transfer reaction between adsorbed H2O and OH species. An experimentally observed decrease in H2O binding energies with coverage is explained in terms of a separation into defect-dominated, intrinsic (0001) terrace, and ""hydrogen-bonding"" regimes, with reasonable quantitative agreement throughout. Calculated O−H vibrational frequencies are consistent with known trends on aluminas but indicate a discrepancy between experimental observations for α-Al2O3 (0001) and models based on simple hydroxylation. Simulations for high H2O coverages suggest the possibility of more complicated behavior, including the interchange of adsorbed and lattice oxygen and the etching of surface Al. A ""fully""-hydroxylated α-Al2O3 (0001) surface in which each surface Al is replaced by three protons to give uniform OH-termination, as in aluminum hydroxides, is the most likely result of prolonged exposure. Results for this surface confirm its anticipated stability, provide a reasonable explanation of observed vibrational spectra, and reveal a complex, dynamical structure with extensive intraplanar hydrogen bonding.",https://openalex.org/W2327471162,2000,K.

The <0.1-, 0.1- to 0.5-, 0.5- to 2-, 2- to 10-, and >10-µm fractions from the 1,250- to 5,500-m stratigraphic interval were analyzed by x-ray diffraction. Major mineralogic changes with depth take place over the interval 2,000 to 3,700 m, after which no significant changes are detectable. The most abundant mineral, illite/smectite, undergoes a conversion from less than 20 percent to about 80 percent illite layers over this interval, after which the proportion of illite layers remains constant. Over the same interval, calcite decreases from about 20 percent of the rock to almost zero, disappearing from progressively larger size fractions with increasing depth; potassium feldspar (but not albite) decreases to zero; and chlorite appears to increase in amount. Variations in the bulk chemical composition of the shale with depth show only minor changes, except for a marked decrease in CaO concomitant with the decrease in calcite. By contrast, the <0.1-µm fraction (virtually pure illite/smectite) shows a large increase in K2O and Al2O3 and a decrease in SiO2 The atomic proportions closely approximate the reaction smectite + Al+3 + K+ = illite + Si+4. The potassium and aluminum appear to be derived from the decomposition of potassium feldspar (and mica?), and the excess silicon probably forms quartz. We interpret all the major mineralogical and chemical changes as the response of the shale to burial metamorphism and conclude that the shale acted as a closed system for all components except H2O, CaO, Na2O, and CO2. Compositional changes in the shale as a function of metamorphic grade closely parallel compositional changes in shale as a function of geologic age.

Molecular Layer Deposition of Alucone Polymer Films Using Trimethylaluminum and Ethylene Glycol,"Polymeric films can be grown by a sequential, self-limiting surface chemistry process known as molecular layer deposition (MLD). The MLD reactants are typically bifunctional monomers for stepwise condensation polymerization and can yield completely organic films. The MLD of organic–inorganic hybrid polymers can also be accomplished using a bifunctional organic monomer and a multifunctional inorganic monomer. In this work, the growth of a poly(aluminum ethylene glycol) polymer is demonstrated using the sequential exposures of trimethylaluminum (TMA) and ethylene glycol (EG). These hybrid polymers, known as alucones, were grown over a wide range of temperatures from 85 to 175 °C. In situ quartz crystal microbalance and ex situ X-ray reflectivity experiments confirmed linear growth of the alucone film versus number of TMA/EG reaction cycles at all temperatures. The alucone growth rates decreased at higher temperatures. Growth rates varied from 4.0 Å per cycle at 85 °C to 0.4 Å per cycle at 175 °C. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the surface reactions during alucone MLD. Ex situ FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray reflectivity measurements were also employed to determine the chemical composition, thickness, and density of the alucone films. These ex situ studies revealed that the alucone films grown on Al2O3 ALD surfaces evolved under ambient conditions before reaching a stable state. Alucone films capped with rapid SiO2 ALD displayed much more stability than alucone films grown on Al2O3 ALD surfaces. These results indicated that H2O may facilitate the chemical transformation of the alucone MLD films. The alucone films represent a new class of organic–inorganic hybrid polymers. Modification of this basic alucone MLD chemistry with use of other diols or other bifunctional monomers can produce different alucone polymers with variable properties.",https://openalex.org/W2008365303,2008,Arrelaine A.

A New Mechanism for Cement Hydration Inhibition:  Solid-State Chemistry of Calcium Nitrilotris(methylene)triphosphonate,"The reaction of the cement retarder nitrilo-tris(methylene)phosphonic acid, N[CH2PO(OH)2]3 (H6ntmp) with calcium oxide, tricalcium silicate (C3S), tricalcium aluminate (C3A), and tetracalcium aluminoferrite (C4AF) has been studied individually, and in the case of C3A in the presence of gypsum, to gain an understanding of the effect on the individual minerals prior to studying a typical sample of Portland cement. The reaction of H6ntmp with calcium oxide results in the initial formation of soluble [Ca(Hnntmp)](4-n)-, which precipitates over time as [Ca(H4ntmp)(H2O)]∞, whose sheetlike structure has been confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The study of the hydration of C3S in the presence of H6ntmp indicates that no C−S−H forms, and the surface changes from silicon-rich to calcium-rich associated with the formation of various calcium phosphonates. The hydration of C3A is severely inhibited in the presence of H6ntmp, with the phosphonic acid reacting primarily with calcium as opposed to aluminum to form a Ca−P-rich layer at the surface of C3A. The H6ntmp enhances calcium solubility, promoting the dissolution of calcium from C3A and promoting, in the presence of gypsum, the formation of ettringite. In the presence of H6ntmp the surface of hydrated Portland cement grains is rich in calcium and phosphorus and deficient in silicon and aluminum, consistent with the formation of a calcium phosphonate coating spectroscopically related to [Ca(H4ntmp)(H2O)]∞. We have proposed a new mechanism by which phosphonic acids inhibit cement hydration. Dissolution, of calcium by extraction with the phosphonic acid, exposes the aluminum-rich surface to enhance hydration, followed by precipitation of a layered calcium phosphonate that binds to the surface of the cement grains, inhibiting further hydration by acting as a diffusion barrier to water as well as a nucleation inhibitor. Samples were characterized by 31P, 27Al, and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.",https://openalex.org/W2025933817,2003,Maximilienne Bishop; Simon G.

Size Dependence of Blackbody Radiation Induced Hydrogen Formation in Al<sup>+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i> Hydrated Aluminum Cations and Their Reactivity with Hydrogen Chloride,"Trapped hydrated aluminum cluster ions are studied by FT-ICR mass spectrometry on a time scale of several seconds. Blackbody radiation, besides causing the fragmentation of the cluster by stepwise loss of individual water molecules, induces in hydrated aluminum clusters Al+(H2O)n an intracluster reaction yielding hydrated hydroxide and releasing molecular hydrogen. Local deviations of the individual rate constants for the water loss process from a linear size dependence are due to increased rigidity of certain sizes due to the formation of stabilizing hydrogen-bonded bridges. In comparison with previously studied hydrated ions, surface versus internal solvation is discussed. The preferential occurrence of the intracluster reaction in the size region of n = 11−24 is attributed to a concerted proton-transfer mechanism, in which a chain of at least two water molecules is needed to transfer a proton between two first solvation shell water molecules, leading to formation of an Al(OH)2+(H2O)n hydrated aluminum dihydroxide cation and molecular hydrogen. The Al+(H2O)n species with n ≥ 13 and all investigated Al(OH)2+(H2O)m species are able to react with and ""dissolve"" HCl. The maximum number of HCl molecules in the cluster strongly depends on the number of water molecules available for solvation. The presence of HCl in the cluster removes the upper limit for the intracluster reaction, which leads to the formation of molecular hydrogen, driven by blackbody radiation. This is taken as further evidence for the validity of the proton-transfer mechanism.",https://openalex.org/W2005941543,1999,Martin K. Beyer; Uwe Achatz; Christian Berg,Technical University of Munich
Investigation of ethanol oxidation over aluminum nanoparticle using ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulation,"Aluminum nanoparticles are an effective and economical additive for producing energetic fuels. In the present study, the state of the art ReaxFF molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been used to uncover the detailed mechanisms of ethanol oxidation over aluminum nanoparticles with different oxidation states. The MD results reveal the dynamics process of ethanol oxidation reactions at nanoscales. The presence of aluminum nanoparticles is found to reduce the initial temperature of ethanol oxidation to 324 K. It is also found that compared to ethanol, oxygen molecules are more easily adsorbed on aluminum surfaces. Moreover, different oxidation states of aluminum nanoparticles influence the initial ethanol reactions on the nanoparticles' surfaces. OH-abstraction is more commonly observed on pure aluminum nanoparticles while H-abstraction prevails on aluminum nanoparticles with oxide. The separated H atom from hydroxyl forms bonds with Al and O atom on aluminum nanoparticles surrounded by thin and thick oxide layers, respectively. Adsorptive dissociation of ethanol is hindered by the oxide layer surrounding the aluminum nanoparticle. Gas products like H2O and CO resulting from ethanol oxidation on aluminum nanoparticles with the thick oxide layer are observed while almost all the C, H and O atoms in ethanol diffuse into the nanoparticles without or with the thin oxide layer. For ethanol dissociation, a higher temperature is required than adsorption. In addition, the rate of ethanol dissociation increases with rising reaction temperatures. The activation energy for ethanol adsorptive dissociation is found to be 4.58 kcal/mol on the aluminum nanoparticle with the thin oxide layer, which is consistent with results from much more expensive DFT calculations.",https://openalex.org/W2822984020,2018,Yi Ran Zhang; Adri C.

Hydrogen uptake in alumina thin films synthesized from an aluminum plasma stream in an oxygen ambient,"We describe the hydrogen uptake during the synthesis of alumina films from H2O present in the high vacuum gas background. The hydrogen concentration in the films was determined by the H1(N15,αγ)C12 nuclear resonance reaction. Furthermore, we show the presence of hydrogen ions in the plasma stream by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The hydrogen content increased in both the film and the plasma stream, as the oxygen partial pressure was increased. On the basis of these measurements and thermodynamic considerations, we suggest that an aluminum oxide hydroxide compound is formed, both on the cathode surface as well as in the film. The large scatter in the data reported in the literature for refractive index and chemical stability of alumina thin films can be explained on the basis of the suggested aluminum oxide hydroxide formation.",https://openalex.org/W2059397872,1999,Jochen M.

A Quantum Chemical Study of the Atomic Layer Deposition of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Using AlCl<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O as Precursors,"Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of alumina (Al2O3) using water and aluminum trichloride (AlCl3) is studied using density functional theory (DFT). The atomistic mechanisms of the two deposition half-cycles on Al2O3−OH* and Al2O3−Cl* surface sites include the formation of stable intermediates and result in high barriers for HCl formation. Increasing the temperature reduces the stability of the intermediates but also increases the desorption rate of adsorbed precursors. Both half-reactions are qualitatively similar to the corresponding reactions of ALD of HfO2 and ZrO2 from H2O and HfCl4 and ZrCl4, respectively, but differ significantly from the reactions of ALD of Al2O3 from Al(CH3)3 and H2O. Although the high electronegativity of Cl increases the stability of the dative-bonded trapped intermediates in the Zr and Hf chloride cases, the inductive effect is stronger for AlCl3, increasing the stability of adsorbed AlCl3 by 29 kcal/mol relative to the adsorption energy of Al(CH3)3. Furthermore, the ligand-exchange barrier is 26 kcal/mol higher for AlCl3 than for Al(CH3)3, thus reducing the reaction kinetics and increasing the ALD temperature for the AlCl3/H2O system. We have also found a new reaction pathway which involves ligand-exchange without metal deposition which we call nongrowth ligand-exchange. This pathway is more competitive in ALD using AlCl3 as the metal precursor than when using Al(CH3)3 and reduces the ALD growth rate. These results provide additional physical insight into the nature of these reaction mechanisms and demonstrate that the Cl ligands have a larger impact on the reaction energetics than the metal atom for the ALD of these high-κ oxides.",https://openalex.org/W2024876728,2004,Annica Heyman; Charles B.

Experimental Study of the Reactions of Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> and Minerals in High-Rank Coal under Formation Conditions,"This study investigates the influence of supercritical CO2 (scCO2) injection on minerals in high-rank coal under the temperature, pressure, and hydrologic conditions of a deep coalbed. A typical high-rank coal reservoir in the Qinshui basin, the #3 coal seam, is the focus of this research. A coal–scCO2 geochemical reaction experiment is conducted to simulate the 2000 m burial depth of the coal seam. Field emission scanning electron microscopy is used to determine the locations of specific minerals and observe the effects of scCO2–H2O on these minerals at the micrometer scale. These results are combined with X-ray diffraction and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry and mass spectrometry analysis results, and the effects of the scCO2–H2O fluid on minerals in the high-rank coal over a short period are discussed. In addition, the influence on coal reservoir structure was studied based on intrusive mercury and liquid nitrogen adsorption experiment. The results suggest that instantaneous CO2 injection can provide a large amount of H+, and the initial ion release rate is high. Because of differences in mineral dissolution rates, scCO2–H2O has the strongest effect on calcite, followed by dolomite, aluminum hydroxide minerals, chlorite, and albite; however, effects are not obvious for illite, kaolinite, and quartz. Because of the low mineral content of the coal and the short experimental period, independent secondary carbon sequestration minerals did not form. However, the surface of aluminum hydroxide minerals reached partial dissolution equilibrium, and new layered aluminum silicate minerals were generated. The dissolution of carbonate minerals, albite, and chlorite increased the pore volume of the coal reservoir and improved the permeability of the samples. New layered aluminum silicate minerals and the chlorite with new occurrence increased the surface areas of samples after the reactions. After the reaction, porosity, pore volume, and surface area of the sample were greater, which also confirmed the positive transformation effect of the mineral changes on the reservoir.",https://openalex.org/W2782133562,2018,Yi Du; Shuxun Sang; Wenfeng Wang,China University of Mining and Technology
Study and interpretation of the chemical characteristics of natural water,"The chemical composition of natural water is derived from many different sources of solutes, including gases and aerosols from the atmosphere, weathering and erosion of rocks and soil, solution or precipitation reactions occurring below the land surface, and cultural effects resulting from activities of man. Some of the processes of solution or precipitation of minerals can be closely evaluated by means of principles of chemical equilibrium including the law of mass action and the Nernst equation. Other processes are irreversible and require consideration of reaction mechanisms and rates. The chemical composition of the crustal rocks of the earth and the composition of the ocean and the atmosphere are significant in evaluating sources of solutes in natural fresh water. The ways in which solutes are taken up or precipitated and the amounts present in solution are influenced by many environmental factors, especially climate, structure and position: of rock strata, and biochemical effects associated with life cycles of plants and animals, both microscopic and macroscopic. Taken all together and in application with the further influence of the general circulation of all water in the hydrologic cycle, the chemical principles and environmental factors form a basis for the developing science of natural-water chemistry. Fundamental data used in the determination of water quality are obtained by the chemical analysis of water samples in the laboratory or onsite sensing of chemical properties in the field. Sampling is complicated by changes in composition of moving water and the effects of particulate suspended material. Most of the constituents determined are reported in gravimetric units, usually milligrams per liter or milliequivalents per liter. More than 60 constituents and properties are included in water analyses frequently enough to provide a basis for consideration of the sources from which each is generally derived, most probable forms of elements and ions in solution, solubility controls, expected concentration ranges and other chemical factors. Concentrations of elements that are commonly present in amounts less than a few tens of micrograms per liter cannot always be easily explained, but present information suggests many are controlled by solubility of hydroxide or carbonate or by sorption on solid particles. Chemical analyses may be grouped and statistically evaluated by averages, frequency distributions, or ion correlations to summarize large volumes of data. Graphing of analyses or of groups of analyses aids in showing chemical relationships among waters, probable sources of solutes, areal water-quality regimen, and water-resources evaluation. Graphs may show water type based on chemical composition, relationships among ions, or groups of ions in individual waters or many waters considered simultaneously. The relationships of water quality to hydrologic parameters, such as stream discharge rate or ground-water flow patterns, can be shown by mathematical equations, graphs, and maps. About 75 water analyses selected from the literature are tabulated to illustrate the relationships described, and some of these, along with many others that are not tabulated, are also utilized in demonstrating graphing and mapping techniques. Relationships of water composition to source rock type are illustrated by graphs of some of the tabulated analyses. Activities of man may modify water composition extensively through direct effects of pollution and indirect results of water development, such as intrusion of sea water in ground-water aquifiers. Water-quality standards for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use have been published by various agencies. Irrigation project requirements for water quality are particularly intricate. Fundamental knowledge of processes that control natural water composition is required for rational management of water quality.",https://openalex.org/W2064299399,1959,John David Hem,
"Reactions of 2,2‘-Methylenebis(4-chloro-6-isopropyl-3-methylphenol) with Trimethylaluminum:  Highly Efficient Catalysts for the Ring-Opening Polymerization of Lactones","The reaction of 2,2‘-methylenebis(4-chloro-6-isopropyl-3-methylphenol) (MCIMP-H2) with 1.2 molar equiv of AlMe3 in THF yields [(MCIMP)AlMe(THF)] (1), which further reacts with a stoichiometric amount of 2-propanol (IPA), affording the isopropoxy-bridged dimer [(MCIMP)Al(μ-OiPr)]2 (2). Compound 2 can also be obtained by the treatment of MCIMP-H2 with a stoichiometric amount of Al(OiPr)3 in refluxing toluene.

Analysis of Nano-Aluminum Particle Dust Cloud Combustion in Different Oxidizer Environments,"The combustion of nano-sized aluminum particles with various oxidizers, including oxygen, air, and water, is studied in a well-characterized laminar particle laden flow by means of both numerical and theoretical approaches. In the numerical analysis, nano-sized aluminum particles are treated as large molecules, which can be regarded as a limiting case when the particle size approaches to zero. The particle laden-flow is then modeled as a onedimensional, laminar, steady flow of a premixed gas mixture. Emphasis is focused on the detailed chemical kinetics and its ensuing effect on the flame structure. A companion theoretical model is also established. The flame is assumed to consist of three zones: preheat, flame. and post flame regimes. By solving the energy equation in each regime and matching the temperature and heat flux at the interfacial boundaries, an algebraic equation for the flame speed is obtained. The analysis allows for the investigation of the effect of particle size, ranging from nano to micro meters in diameter, on the burning characteristics of aluminum oxidizer mixtures. In the molecular limit, the numerical results indicate that the flame speeds of an aluminum mixture with air are significantly higher than that with H2O, mainly due to the greater reaction rate of Al with O2 versus H2O. The kinetic bottleneck results from the Al2O3 formation, in which O atoms play an influential role, in the aluminum-steam system. For micro-sized particles, the theoretical analysis shows that the aluminum-steam flame speed is slightly larger than that of an aluminum-air mixture. The phenomenon may be attributed to the high diffusivities of oxidizer and the presence of H2 and H in reaction products for a H2O system.",https://openalex.org/W2123565177,2005,Ying Huang; Grant A.

Mo/HMCM-22 Catalysts for Methane Dehydroaromatization:  A Multinuclear MAS NMR Study,"Detailed NMR investigations on fresh and coked Mo/HMCM-22 catalysts for methane dehydro-aromatization were presented. Al-27 MAS and Si-29 MAS as well as corresponding CP/MAS NMR experiments have proved that an interaction between molybdenum and the zeolite lattice occurs during the impregnation and calcination processes of the catalysts. With Bronsted acid sites serving as a powerful trap, molybdenum migrates into the internal channels of the zeolite and reacts preferentially with bridging hydroxyls groups. Thus, molybdenum is anchored to the framework aluminum through an oxygen bridge, which, in turn, modifies the acidic properties of the HMCM-22 and leads to a high dispersion of the molybdenum. If this kind of interaction becomes stronger, expelling of aluminum from the zeolite lattice would occur, with the forming of both octahedral nonframework aluminum and Al-2(MoO4)(3) crystallites, The latter can be hydrated to [Al(OH)(n)(H2O)(6-n)](n)(MoO4) (n = 1 or 2) in a water-saturated desiccator and can give a line at ca. 14 ppm in the Al-27 MAS NMR spectrum. UV-Raman results suggest that the carbonaceous deposits on the catalysts are mainly hydrogen-deficient aromatic type, which are also verified by H-1 --&gt; Si-29 CP/MAS and H-1 --&gt; Al-27 CP/MAS NMR, as well as the failure for conducting the C-13 CP/MAS NMR experiment. H-1 --&gt; Al-27 CP/MAS NMR experiments indicate that most of the coke is deposited on framework aluminum (Bronsted site). Regeneration in an oxygen atmosphere leads to the formation of a considerable amount of Al-2(MoO4)(3) crystallites. However, the catalytic activity can be properly restored after the regeneration; thus, the idea of taking this species as the detrimental factor for this reaction can be ruled out. On the other hand, lattice destruction of the zeolite is suggested to be responsible for the poor performance exhibited by the 10Mo/HMCM-22 catalyst. The synergic effect between molybdenum and Bronsted acid sites is considered to be the main reason for the outstanding catalytic performance of the 6Mo/HMCM-22 catalyst.",https://openalex.org/W1981812796,2001,Ding Ma; Yuying Shu; Xiuwen Han,Chinese Academy of Sciences; Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics
Catalyzed Oxidation of Arsenic(III) by Hydrogen Peroxide on the Surface of Ferrihydrite:  An in Situ ATR-FTIR Study,"Knowledge of arsenic redox kinetics is crucial for understanding the impact and fate of As in the environment and for optimizing As removal from drinking water. Rapid oxidation of As(III) adsorbed to ferrihydrite (FH) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) might be expected for two reasons. First, the adsorbed As(III) is assumed to be oxidized more readily than the undissociated species in solution. Second, catalyzed decomposition of H2O2 on the FH surface might also lead to As(III) oxidation. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to monitor the oxidation of adsorbed As(III) on the FH surface in situ. No As(III) oxidation within minutes to hours was observed prior to H2O2 addition. Initial pseudo-first-order oxidation rate coefficients for adsorbed As(III), determined at H2O2 concentrations between 8.4 microM and 8.4 mM and pH values from 4 to 8, increased with the H2O2 concentration according to the equation log k(ox) (min(-1)) = 0.17 + 0.50 log [H2O] (mol/L), n = 21, r2 = 0.87. Only a weak pH dependence of log k(ox) was observed (approximately 0.04 logarithm unit increase per pH unit). ATR-FTIR experiments with As(III) adsorbed onto amorphous aluminum hydroxide showed that Fe was necessary to induce As(III) oxidation by catalytic H2O2 decomposition. Supplementary As(III) oxidation experiments in FH suspensions qualitatively confirmed the findings from the in situ ATR-FTIR experiments. Our results indicate that the catalyzed oxidation of As(III) by H2O2 on the surface of iron (hydr)oxides might be a relevant reaction pathway in environmental systems such as surface waters, as well as in engineered systems for As removal from water.",https://openalex.org/W2033475368,2003,Andreas Voegelin; Stephan J.

"Inorganic Multilayer Films of Manganese Oxide Nanosheets and Aluminum Polyoxocations:  Fabrication, Structure, and Electrochemical Behavior","Inorganic multilayer films of exfoliated MnO2 nanosheets and aluminum Keggin ions have been fabricated onto various substrates via sequential adsorption. Ultraviolet−visible absorption spectra in the multilayer buildup process indicated that nearly equal amounts of nanosheets could be assembled for each deposition cycle. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic quantitative analysis and structural consideration based on charge balance indicate that aluminum Keggin ions should be sparsely distributed in the nanosheet galleries, occupying only 13% of the gallery area. This low density of Keggin ions can explain a Bragg peak observed with a relatively small periodicity of 0.73 nm, suggesting that a major gallery area accommodates H2O molecules. This unique structure is different from ordinary multilayer structures, in which two components alternate, contributing to the film thickness with their own sizes. The multilayer film showed a very stable cyclic voltammogram involving reversible redox reactions of MnIII/MnIV, providing new potential electrodes for electrochemical applications. The observed electron transfer suggests that a predominant amount of MnO2 nanosheets in multilayer films was electrochemically active.",https://openalex.org/W2068313768,2005,Wang; Nobuyuki Sakai; Yasuo Ebina,National Institute for Materials Science
Theoretical Studies of Boron−Water Cluster Ions B<sup>+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i> and Aluminum−Water Cluster Ions Al<sup>+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>:  Isomers and Intracluster Reactions,"With ab initio molecular orbital calculations, structures of the singly positive charged boron−water clusters B+(H2O)n and aluminum−water clusters Al+(H2O)n are determined. The insertion reaction products HBOH+(H2O)n-1 and HAlOH+(H2O)n-1 are also investigated. Structures of the dimer-core clusters [M+(H2O)2](H2O)n-2 are similar to each other for M = B and Al. In contrast, the stability and structures of [B+(H2O)](H2O)n-1 and [Al+(H2O)](H2O)n-1 are quite different. The monomer-core boron clusters [B+(H2O)](H2O)n-1 do not have stable local minima; the spontaneous proton transfer reaction takes place to form BOH(H3O)+(H2O)n-2. In other words, the acid−base reaction takes place in such small clusters. In the larger clusters, the reaction further proceeds and the clusters isomerize to the linear type HBOH+(H2O)n-1. On the other hand, in the clusters [Al+(H2O)](H2O)n-1, no such reaction takes place. The cis-form hydrated products of the insertion reaction HMOH+(H2O)n-1 are more reactive, and the acid−base reaction is seen for both M = B and Al.",https://openalex.org/W2039787577,1996,Hidekazu Watanabe; Suehiro Iwata,"Institute for Molecular Science; Keio University; The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI"
Chemical failure modes of AlQ3-based OLEDs: AlQ3 hydrolysis,"Tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum(III), AlQ3, is used in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) as an electron-transport material and emitting layer. The reaction of AlQ3 with trace H2O has been implicated as a major failure pathway for AlQ3-based OLEDs. Hybrid density functional calculations have been carried out to characterize the hydrolysis of AlQ3. The thermochemical and atomistic details for this important reaction are reported for both the neutral and oxidized AlQ3/AlQ3+ systems. In support of experimental conclusions, the neutral hydrolysis reaction pathway is found to be a thermally activated process, having a classical barrier height of 24.2 kcal mol(-1). First-principles infrared and electronic absorption spectra are compared to further characterize AlQ3 and the hydrolysis pathway product, AlQ2OH. The activation energy for the cationic AlQ3 hydrolysis pathway is found to be 8.5 kcal mol(-1) lower than for the neutral reaction, which is significant since it suggests a role for charge imbalance in promoting chemical failure modes in OLED devices.",https://openalex.org/W2016059844,2006,John E.

Fundamental Study on Mechanisms of Thermal Decomposition and Oxidation of Aluminum Hydride,"Aluminum hydride (AlH3) has great potential for a variety of propulsion and energy-storage applications. In this study, the ReaxFF reactive force field molecular dynamics simulation is employed to investigate the fundamental reaction mechanisms of thermal decomposition and oxidation of AlH3. The effects of an oxide layer and/or defect are examined, and the detailed process and mechanism of H2 and H2O formation are illustrated. With the presence of an oxide layer, H2 production of core–shell AlH3 during the thermal decomposition is slower than that of bare AlH3. As far as oxidation is concerned, any defect enhances the initiation of core–shell AlH3 oxidation and accelerates the oxidation at the early stage of the reaction. Additionally, the presence of O2 promotes the production of OH. Both thermal decomposition and oxidation of core–shell AlH3 show significant H2O production, and H2O is preferentially formed compared with H2 at the beginning of the reaction. The results reveal that the structural evolution of core–shell AlH3 during the thermal decomposition and oxidation proceeds in three distinctive stages, respectively. It is found that during the oxidation, dehydrogenation and oxidation proceed simultaneously although the oxidation rate is limited during the dehydrogenation period.",https://openalex.org/W2973167549,2019,Muye Feng; Heping Li; Qian Mao,University College London; Hangzhou Dianzi University; RWTH Aachen University
Optical band gaps and composition dependence of hafnium–aluminate thin films grown by atomic layer chemical vapor deposition,"We report the optical properties of unannealed hafnium–aluminate (HfAlO) films grown by atomic layer chemical vapor deposition (ALCVD) and correlate them with the aluminum contents in the films. Vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopic ellipsometry (VUV-SE), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), channeling Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), and resonant nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) were employed to characterize these films. In the analyses of ellipsometry data, a double Tauc–Lorentz dispersion produces a best fit to the experimental VUV-SE data. As a result, the determined complex pseudodielectric ⟨ε⟩ functions of the films clearly exhibit a dependency on the aluminum densities measured by RBS and NRA. We show that the optical fundamental band gap Eg shifts from 5.56±0.05eV for HfO2 to 5.92±0.05eV for HfAlO. The latter was grown by using an equal number of pulses of H2O∕HfCl4 and H2O∕TMA (trimethylaluminum) precursors in each deposition cycle for HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively. The shift of Eg to higher photon energies with increasing aluminum content indicates that intermixing of HfO2 and Al2O3 occurred during the ALCVD growth process. We found that Eg varies linearly with the mole fraction x of Al2O3 in the alloy (HfO2)x(Al2O3)1−x, but has a parabolic dependency with the aluminum density. We also observed a consistent decrease in the magnitudes of the real ⟨ε1⟩ and imaginary ⟨ε2⟩ part of ⟨ε⟩ of HfAlO films with respect to those of HfO2 as the Al density increased. The absence of the ≈5.7eV peak in the ⟨ε⟩ spectrum, which was previously reported for polycrystalline HfO2 films, indicates that these films are amorphous as confirmed by their HRTEM images.",https://openalex.org/W2038812561,2005,Nhan V.

Effect of precursor concentration in atomic layer deposition of Al2O3,"The effect of precursor gas-phase concentration in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 on Si(001) using Al(CH3)3 and H2O was investigated. Film growth rate was found to vary with Al(CH3)3 and H2O partial pressure, indicating that the process operates in a regime where complete conversion of surface sites is not reached when reactions self-extinguish. Higher precursor concentrations lead to higher conversion of surface sites as evidenced by faster film growth per ALD cycle. However, higher H2O concentrations also result in increasing amounts of aluminum silicate at the Al2O3/Si(001) interface. In addition to lower dielectric constants, flatband voltages increase by 0.5–0.6 V. Flatband voltage did not depend on the thickness of the interfacial layer as films with comparable capacitance equivalent thickness and interfacial thicknesses ranging from 2.2 to 11.1 Å yielded identical flatband voltages. Interfacial silicate could be eliminated completely by reducing the gas-phase concentration of H2O, permitting Al2O3 to form an abrupt interface with Si(001).",https://openalex.org/W1494720521,2003,Ronald Kuse; Manisha Kundu; Tetsuji Yasuda,National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology
Ab Initio Calculation of Aqueous Aluminum and Aluminum−Carboxylate Complex Energetics and <sup>27</sup>Al NMR Chemical Shifts,Al3+ hydrolysis in aqueous solution was modeled with ab initio calculations. Structural changes surrounding the cation as protons are removed from the initial Al3+(H2O)6 molecular cluster were predicted. A correlation of the model energy changes and experimental equilibrium constants for these reactions was also found. Calculations of the 27Al NMR chemical shift between the species Al3+(H2O)6 and [Al(OH)4]- were performed to test the feasibility of predicting 27Al NMR chemical shifts in aqueous solution with gas-phase molecular orbital calculations on small clusters. Energetics of Al3+−carboxylic acid complex formation in solution were also calculated using the self-consistent isodensity polarized continuum model (SCIPCM) to account for long-range solvation effects. Comparisons of calculated 27Al NMR chemical shifts in model Al3+−carboxylate complexes to experimentally assigned values were made to test this methodology and previous peak assignments in 27Al NMR spectra of Al3+−carboxylic acid solutions. Results suggest that NMR peaks observed in acidic solutions of carboxylic acids should be re-interpreted in terms of monodentate or protonated bidentate species. Peaks observed as solution pH increases are likely due to formation of aluminum oligomers complexing with ligands and not bidentate complexes with isolated Al3+ cations as previously interpreted.,https://openalex.org/W2013547693,1999,James D.

Thermal Decomposition of Aluminum Chloride Hexahydrate,"The decomposition rate of aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl3·6H2O) was measured as weight loss at ambient pressure and elevated temperatures up to 270 °C. Such incomplete thermal decomposition produces a porous and reactive basic aluminum chloride [Al2O3·2HCl·2H2O or Al2(OH)4Cl2·H2O] which dissolves in water to give poly(aluminum chloride) used as an efficient flocculation agent. A slowly rising temperature method and very small sample masses, which minimize heat and mass transfer intrusions, were employed to determine intrinsic reaction rates. A fractional order kinetic equation of Arrhenius type was proposed for the decomposition and tested also against the results amassed by experiment in a constant temperature mode. This correlation allows the estimation of the reaction rate as a function of temperature and the extent of decomposition. It can be readily employed in modeling and simulation of the decomposition process. The contents of aluminum and chlorine in the decomposed solids were also explored in the course of the decomposition process.

Atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 thin films using dimethylaluminum isopropoxide and water,"Dimethylaluminum isopropoxide (DMAI), (CH3)2AlOCH(CH3)2, a precursor originally developed for the metalorganic chemical vapor deposition of alumina, was adopted as a new precursor for growing aluminum oxide thin films on HF-treated Si(001) substrates by atomic layer deposition (ALD). This precursor is stable for a prolonged period of storage time under inert atmosphere (such as in nitrogen or argon) and does not react vigorously in air, and therefore is easy to handle and safe, without causing hazards. The self-limiting ALD process by alternate surface reactions of DMAI and H2O was confirmed by thicknesses of the grown aluminum oxide films measured as functions of the DMAI pulse time and the number of DMAI-H2O cycles. A maximum growth rate of ∼1.06 Å/cycle was achieved in the substrate temperature range ∼120–150 °C. Growth of stoichiometric Al2O3 thin films without appreciable carbon incorporation was verified by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Atomic force microscopy images showed atomically flat and uniform surfaces. In particular, a cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image of an Al2O3 film shows that there is no distinguishable interfacial oxide layer between the Al2O3 film and the Si substrate.

Atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 on H-passivated Si. I. Initial surface reaction pathways with H/Si(100)-2×1,"Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is currently under investigation for use as a high-κ gate dielectric alternative to SiO2. Cluster calculations employing hybrid density functional theory have been carried out to examine the chemical reaction pathways between the ALD precursors, trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O, with the H/Si(100)-2×1 surface. Results obtained using Si9H14 and Si15H20, dimer and double dimer clusters to represent the surface active site are in good agreement, providing a consistent view of reaction energetics on the H/Si(100)-2×1 surface. The adsorption energies for TMA and H2O on the surface are calculated to be 0.02 and 0.15 eV, respectively. For the reaction between H2O and the H/Si(100)-2×1 surface, hydroxylation of the surface accompanied by loss of H2 was found to be the preferred pathway having an activation energy and overall reaction enthalpy of 1.60 eV and −0.75 eV, both of which are ⩾0.70 eV lower than the corresponding values for the possible H/D exchange reaction. TMA exposure of the H/Si(100)-2×1 surface favors the deposition of –Al(CH3)2 with loss of CH4, having a barrier height of 1.30 eV and reaction enthalpy of −0.31 eV, which are 0.10 and 0.40 eV lower than the surface methylation pathway (H/CH3 exchange) and 2.64 and 0.45 eV lower in energy than the H2 loss reaction, that results in the deposition of –CH2–Al(CH3)2 to the surface. Therefore, the dominant reactions identified in this work are those with direct implication in the Al2O3 ALD growth mechanism, leading to the formation of Si–O and Si–Al species on the H/Si(100)-2×1 surface.",https://openalex.org/W2000900802,2003,Mathew D.

Experimental and Computational Study of Hydration Reactions of Aluminum Oxide Anion Clusters,"Hydration of aluminum oxide anion clusters was studied in the gas phase using an ion trap secondary ion mass spectrometer. Hydration of both AlO2- and Al2O4H- occurred by the consecutive addition of two H2O molecules. For hydration of AlO2-, the rate constants for addition of the first and second water molecules are 4 × 10-11 and 4 × 10-10 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, respectively. The first and second hydration rate constants for Al2O4H- are 2 × 10-9 and 8 × 10-10 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, respectively. A comparison of the experimental rate constants to the theoretical rate constants reveals that addition of the first H2O to AlO2- is only 2% efficient, whereas addition of the first H2O to Al2O4H- is 100% efficient. Ab initio calculations were performed to assist in the interpretation of the kinetic results. Reaction mechanisms and energetics for the hydration of the AlO2- system were calculated using the HF/6-311+G(d(Al),p), B3LYP/6-31+G(d), B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p), B3LYP/6-311+G(3d2f,2p), and MP2/6-311+G(2d,p) levels of theory. Calculations on the hydration of the Al2O4H- system were performed using the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level of theory. Ab initio results revealed that the addition of the first and second waters, for both the AlO2- and Al2O4H- systems, results in the formation of four-membered transition states, with simultaneous Al−O bond formation and proton transfer. However, a significant later transition state is observed, with respect to the Al−O and H−O bond lengths, for the addition of the second water molecule in the Al2O4H- system. A comparison of the reaction mechanisms and energetics was not sufficient to account for the 2 orders of magnitude difference in rate constants; however, the reactivity differences do correlate with the dipole moment of the aluminum oxide anions, which may serve to preorient the incoming water molecule, thus enhancing the reaction rate.",https://openalex.org/W2043392844,2000,Jill R.

Synthesis and Charge Transport Properties of Redox-Active Nitroxide Polyethers with Large Site Density,"To maximize the theoretical redox capacity of polymers containing cyclic nitroxides as redox-active pendant groups for high-density charge storage application, a compact five-membered ring with the smallest equivalent weight among the robust cyclic nitroxides was directly bound to a poly(ethylene oxide) chain. 2,2,5,5-Tetramethyl-3-oxiranyl-3-pyrrolin-1-oxyl was synthesized and polymerized via anionic coordinated ring-opening polymerization utilizing diethyl zinc/H2O as an initiator. The unpaired electron in the monomer survived during the polymerization, giving rise to a high density redox polymer with a weight-specific theoretical capacity of 147 mA h/g. Cyclic voltammetry of the polymer layer confined at the surface of an electrode revealed a large redox capacity comparable to the theoretical capacity, which was ascribed to the efficient swelling and yet insoluble properties of the polyether in electrolyte solutions by virtue of the high molecular weight of >105 and adhesive properties allowing immobilization of the layer on the electrode surface. The redox capacity also indicated that the ionophoric polyether matrix accommodated electrolyte anions through the polymer/electrolyte interface to neutralize positive charges produced by the oxidation of the neutral radicals at the polymer/electrode interface. The diffusion coefficient for the redox gradient-driven charge hopping process corresponded to a large second-order rate constant in the order of 107 M−1 s−1, which suggested an efficient electron self-exchange reaction throughout the polymer layer due to the large redox site population and hence to the small intersite distance. Test cells fabricated with a polymer/carbon fiber composite layer on an aluminum current collector as the cathode and a Li anode sandwiching an electrolyte layer were capable of charging and discharging as a secondary battery with an output voltage near 3.7 V and were durable for more than 103 charging−discharging cycles without substantial degradation.",https://openalex.org/W1997502793,2010,Kenichi Oyaizu; Takeshi Kawamoto; Takeo Suga,Waseda University
High H <sub>2</sub> Adsorption in a Microporous Metal–Organic Framework with Open Metal Sites,"A copper-based metal–organic framework (MOF) has been synthesized, and its structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography (see picture; Cu blue, C black, O red, framework pore yellow). The remarkably high hydrogen adsorption properties (2.47 wt %) of this compound have been studied. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a rapidly growing class of porous materials that are studied for their amenability to design1 and extraordinary permanent porosity.2 The recent discovery that MOFs take up significant amounts of hydrogen has further intensified research in this area.3 In particular, the focus remains on identifying strategies for designing MOFs with high hydrogen-storage capacities. We have already found that both the metal-oxide units and the organic links are important features for hydrogen binding,3a,3d and that interpenetrating MOFs take up more hydrogen than their noninterpenetrating counterparts.3d In this report, we highlight the synthesis and structure of a MOF (named MOF-505) based on the NbO topology which has two kinds of pores, open metal sites, permanent porosity, and a high capacity for hydrogen adsorption. We have previously synthesized MOFs with Cu2(CO2)4 “paddle-wheel” units, and illustrated their use in the design of 0-periodic discrete4 and 3-periodic extended structures.5, 10 MOF-505 was synthesized under analogous conditions: the solvothermal reaction of 3,3′,5,5′-biphenyltetracarboxylic acid (H4bptc; 25 mg, 0.076 mmol)6 and Cu(NO3)2⋅(H2O)2.5 (52 mg, 0.22 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/ethanol/H2O (3:3:2 v/v/v) at 65 °C for 24 h gave green, block-shaped crystals (47 mg, 86 % yield based on H4bptc). The compound was formulated as [Cu2(bptc)(H2O)2(dmf)3(H2O)] by elemental microanalysis7 and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies.8 The Cu2(CO2)4 unit is a square secondary building unit (SBU; Figure 1 A1) that is defined by the carboxylate carbon atoms, and the bptc4− unit is a rectangular SBU that is defined by the 3, 3′, 5, and 5′ carbon atoms (Figure 1 B). The carboxylate functionalities of the bptc4− ligand are nearly coplanar with the biphenyl rings (the dihedral angle between the carboxylate group and the phenyl ring is 7.4°).2 Thus, when the square SBUs are linked to the biphenyl rings, they must be mutually orthogonal (Figure 1 C), an aspect that is the hallmark of the NbO topology.9, 10 The crystal structure of MOF-505 (Figures 1 D and E1) clearly shows that the link has predisposed the inorganic square SBUs at nearly 90° angles (94.4°) to the organic rectangular SBUs. This arrangement yields an overall 3-periodic network which has two kinds of pores. The first of these pores is defined by six inorganic SBUs (representing the faces of a cubic NbO subunit) with a spherical volume of 290 Å3 and a pore diameter of 8.30 Å (Figures 1 D and F1), while the second, and larger, pore is defined by six organic SBUs (again representing the faces of a cubic NbO subunit) and has a solvent-accessible void of 540 Å3 with a pore diameter of 10.10 Å (Figures 1 E and G1).11 These roughly spherical pores are arranged in a rhombohedrally distorted CsCl-type fashion with the small pores surrounded by eight large pores, each of which is also surrounded by eight small pores. There are a total of six pores (three large and three small) per unit cell, which are coupled through an interconnected porous network of 6.70 Å diameter apertures. This provides a total accessible free volume of 2713 Å3 (37.1 %).11, 12 The single-crystal X-ray structure of MOF-505 showing A) Cu2(CO2)4 units (blue, square SBUs) and B) bptc4− units (red, rectangular SBUs) that are C) orthogonally joined. The overall 3-periodic crystal structure (D, E; Cu blue, C black, O red, and the yellow sphere represents the largest sphere that would occupy the cavity without contacting the interior van der Waals surface) has two different types of pores and an underlying NbO-type net (F, G). Hydrogen atoms, guest molecules, and terminal solvent molecules have been omitted for clarity. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were used to evaluate the framework stability under solvent-exchange conditions. PXRD reveals the same pattern of intense diffraction lines in each of the simulated, as-synthesized, and acetone-exchanged materials (see Supporting Information). However, upon desolvation of the exchanged material, decreased diffraction intensities and broadened reflections were observed in the PXRD pattern. This indicates some loss of long-range order but not necessarily loss of porosity, as detailed below. To examine the thermal stability of MOF-505 and estimate the temperature of desolvation we conducted a TGA study: the weight loss of 30.83 % below 250 °C corresponds to the liberation of 2.5 acetone molecules and three water molecules per Cu2bptc formula unit (calcd: 30.53 %). To evaluate whether the framework structure is maintained upon evacuation of the pores, we obtained the gas sorption isotherms using a Cahn C-1000 microgravimetric balance to measure the change in mass of samples suspended within a glass enclosure under a chosen gas atmosphere. The as-synthesized MOF-505 crystalline sample was activated by immersion in acetone for 72 h (3×50 mL for 24 h each) to exchange the dmf guests. The resulting damp, blue-green solid (617 mg) was loaded into the apparatus and evacuated (<10−3 Torr) in three stages (I–III), with both weight loss and color changes being recorded (stage I: 15 h at room temperature (weight decreased to 358 mg, 42.0 % weight loss, light blue); stage II: heating at 70 °C for 15 h (weight decreased to 325 mg, 5.3 % weight loss, dark blue); and stage III: a final dehydration at 120 °C for 12 h (weight decreased to 296 mg, 4.7 % weight loss, purple)), to leave the evacuated sample. Nitrogen and hydrogen isotherms were obtained at each of these activation stages (I–III) as elaborated below. To ensure complete removal of all volatile contaminants from the system, the gas manifold was evacuated overnight and heated to 100 °C prior to the introduction of gas. The system was purged three times at room temperature with the gas to be studied (ultra-high-purity grade, 99.999 %) before cooling to 77 K with liquid nitrogen. The sample temperature was monitored by a thermocouple suspended in close proximity to the sample. Pressures were measured with two MKS Baratron 622 A pressure transducers (10 and 1000 Torr, accuracy ±0.25 % of range). The gas was introduced incrementally and data points were recorded when no further change in mass was observed (<0.02 mg per 10 min). An empirical buoyancy correction was applied to all data points based on the buoyancy experienced by standard aluminum foil weights within the pressure range of the gas at 77 K. Nitrogen sorption by this material clearly shows reversible type-I isotherms at each of the activation stages (Figure 2), indicative of permanent porosity. At stage I (25 °C), an uptake of 278 mg g−1 is achieved, with an equivalent Langmuir surface area (As) of 967 m2 g−1, and Kequation/tex2gif-inf-25.gif=0.193 for a 16.2 Å2 molecular cross-section. Assuming liquid-nitrogen density (0.808 g cm−3) in the pores, extrapolation of the Dubinin–Radushkevich equation13 from the low-pressure data points yields an available micropore volume (Vp) of 0.33 cm3 g−1. Further evacuation of the pores (stage II) removes an additional 5.3 % of guests, providing a 36 % greater uptake (386 mg g−1, As=1343 m2 g−1, Kequation/tex2gif-inf-29.gif=0.327, and Vp=0.45 cm3 g−1) than that observed in the first stage. The fully activated material obtained after stage III shows a substantial increase in the sorption to give a final N2 uptake of 526 mg g−1 (As=1830 m2 g−1, Kequation/tex2gif-inf-34.gif=0.362, and Vp=0.63 cm3 g−1). These data are summarized in Table 1. N2 isotherms for MOF-505 (77 K) after three different activation stages: stage I (25 °C, squares), stage II (70 °C, triangles), and stage III (120 °C, circles); filled shapes indicate adsorption and open shapes indicate desorption data points. Activation Uptake [mg g−1] As [m2 g−1][a] Kequation/tex2gif-inf-39.gif [Torr−1][a,c] Kequation/tex2gif-inf-41.gif [Torr−1][a,d] Vp [cm3 g−1][b] Stage T [°C] N2 H2 I 25 278 14.1 967 0.193 0.0071 0.33 II 70 386 19.7 1343 0.327 0.0070 0.45 III 120 526 24.7 1830 0.362 0.0086 0.63 The hydrogen isotherms of MOF-505 measured at 77 K at the same stages of activation are shown in Figure 3. This temperature is well above the critical temperature (33 K) for hydrogen,14 which suggests that condensation in the pores would be unlikely and complete saturation would not be achieved without much higher pressures. The isotherms measured (0 to 750 Torr) did not show saturation; however, the maximum uptake at 750 Torr for each of the three hydrogen isotherms demonstrates similar increases in capacity to those observed in the nitrogen isotherms, with the fully activated MOF-505 adsorbing an exceptional 2.47 wt % hydrogen at 750 Torr and 77 K. This extraordinary hydrogen sorption capacity is unprecedented in previously reported MOF materials under these conditions.3h H2 isotherms for MOF-505 (77 K) after three different activation stages: stage I (25 °C, squares), stage II (70 °C, triangles), and stage III (120 °C, circles); filled shapes indicate adsorption and open shapes indicate desorption data points. Removal of noncoordinated guests during activation has at least two positive effects on the adsorption capacity: a decrease of sample mass and an increase of available micropore volume and specific surface area. However, removal of the water ligands (bound axially to the copper centers) has the same benefits and also introduces open metal sites that we think enhance the hydrogen–framework interaction. The existence of such open metal sites in MOFs has been confirmed previously by single-crystal X-ray diffraction of MOF-11.5b Room temperature evacuation overnight (stage I) yields an initial hydrogen uptake of 14.1 mg g−1 (1.41 wt % H2; Table 1). The second activation step (stage II) removes an additional 5.3 wt % (partial dehydration) and increases the hydrogen uptake by 5.6 mg g−1 (19.7 mg g−1, 1.97 wt % H2). Further removal of 4.7 wt % (stage III, complete dehydration) increases the hydrogen uptake capacity by an additional 5.0 mg g−1 to 24.7 mg g−1 or 2.47 wt % H2. Upon comparison, the initial activation step (stage I, evacuation of bulk guests) shows an increase in hydrogen sorption of 0.34 mg g−1 per percent mass loss whereas the last two activation steps (stages II and III, dehydration with loss of six water molecules per Cu2bptc formula unit) show a corresponding increase of 1.06 mg g−1 per percent mass loss during activation. Indeed, at stage I the H2 uptake (77 K) is 14.1 mg g−1, while the fully activated material (stage III) containing open metal sites displays an uptake nearly twice as high (24.7 mg g−1) despite only a 10 % mass loss. The lack of any hysteresis in the isotherm illustrates that this physisorption process is completely reversible, and that the presence of these open metal sites does not hamper the desorption process, nor do the pore apertures of 6.70 Å significantly hinder small-molecule diffusion through the host framework. Although there are slight curvatures in the Langmuir plots (leading to some degree of uncertainty) some insight pertinent to this specific system can still be gleaned. Increasing Kequation/tex2gif-inf-54.gif values reveal a trend toward increasing hydrogen affinity of the fully dehydrated framework relative to the partially evacuated material (Table 1). Although we speculate that the open metal sites have a favorable impact on the hydrogen sorption capacity of MOF-505, further experimentation is required to verify this. Another plausible explanation for the high hydrogen uptake capacity of MOF-505 is a simple correlation between specific surface area (As) and uptake. Similar correlations have been made for activated carbons and zeolites15 but have yet to be established for MOF materials. In fact, we would like to specifically point out that, so far, MOF materials with very high surface areas (1000–4500 m2 g−1) do not cleanly follow this correlation.3d Nevertheless, we do observe that each stage of activation is accompanied by distinct changes in sample color, which is consistent with a change in the coordination environment of the metal sites as a result of the removal of terminal ligands. As-synthesized MOF-505 is blue-green and the first-stage activation changes this to light blue; further activation deepens the blue color, while the final activation step yields a deep-purple material. An activated sample exposed to ambient air for 36 h shows a dramatic color change from purple back to blue-green, with the subsequent TGA showing a loss of 18.7 wt % below 250 °C, corresponding to the loss of six water molecules per Cu2bptc formula unit (calcd: 19.3 %). Undoubtedly, two of these water molecules are axially coordinated to the paddle wheels, while the remaining four may be located in the equatorial quadrants defined by adjacent carboxylate groups of every paddle wheel. At present, we are targeting the application of MOFs to gas sorption and selective separations in order to establish their optimal performance and to establish principles for improved inert-gas storage capacities. The unprecedented 2.47 wt % H2 uptake of MOF-505 is an important milestone toward achieving these objectives.

Effect of crystalline phases of aluminum hydroxide catalysts on Al‐water reaction,"Previous works indicated that aluminum hydroxide could be acted as catalyst to speed up the hydrolysis reaction of Al, and the catalytic activity of aluminum hydroxide is related to its microscopic properties. In this work, the effect of crystalline phases of aluminum hydroxide catalysts on Al hydrolysis is researched systematically. The results show that the hydrogen production performance of Al hydrolysis catalyzed by aluminum hydroxide with different crystalline phases is obviously different, and the catalytic activity of different aluminum hydroxides is in the order of boehmite > bayerite > gibbsite. A possible mechanism is given, which reveals that the surface hydroxyl groups of aluminum hydroxide act as anchoring sites for the adsorption of H2O molecules and decrease the dissociative adsorption energy of H2O molecules on aluminum hydroxides surface, promoting the hydrolysis reaction of Al. Consequently, the difference in catalytic activity of aluminum hydroxide with different crystalline phases is attributed to the difference in surface hydroxyl group density. This study provides a new idea for the synthesization of aluminum hydroxide with excellent catalytic activity.",https://openalex.org/W3006846755,2020,Wei‐Zhuo Gai; Xianghui Zhang; Yang Yang,Luoyang Normal University; Shanghai University

Reaction Mechanism of the Aluminum Nanoparticle: Physicochemical Reaction and Heat/Mass Transfer,"A lack of clarity in the reaction mechanism of the aluminum nanoparticle (ANP) severely restricts its effective applications. By describing the physicochemical evolution of ANP burning in typical oxidizers (CO2, H2O, and O-2 ) at the nanoscale, three principal reaction modes including physical adsorption, chemical adsorption, and reactive diffusion were captured during the reaction. Initially, oxidizer molecules are physically and chemically adsorbed on the ANP surface until ignition in which reaction heat plays a more important role in contrast to heat transfer. Subsequently, partial oxidizer atoms adsorbed by surface diffuse across the shell to react with the Al core, presenting the dominant mode of reactive diffusion. It is assumed that the binding energy between Al and oxidizer atoms is in an inverse relation to atomic diffusivity but is positively correlated to reaction heat, resulting in various ANP structures and heat release rates. Our findings provide design guidelines to control various oxidizer supplies with respect to the reaction stages to balance the energy release and the residence time of ANP.",https://openalex.org/W2999545819,2020,Qingzhao Chu; Baolu Shi; Lijuan Liao,Beijing Institute of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Mechanics
Carboxylate-Substituted Alumoxanes as Processable Precursors to Transition Metal−Aluminum and Lanthanide−Aluminum Mixed-Metal Oxides:  Atomic Scale Mixing via a New Transmetalation Reaction,"Carboxylate−alumoxanes, [Al(O)x(OH)y(O2CR)z]n, have been uniformly doped with a transition metal or lanthanide. Thermolysis of the doped alumoxanes yields homogeneous mixed-metal oxides. The carboxylate−alumoxanes were synthesized by the reaction of boehmite, [Al(O)(OH)]n, with either hexanoic, octanoic, methacrylic, or [(methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acids. Reaction of the carboxylate alumoxane with either a metal acetylacetonate complex, M(acac)3 (M = Mn, La, Er), V(O)(acac)2, or a salt, [NH4]2[Ce(NO3)6] and [NH4]4[Ce(SO4)4], results in transmetalation and the formation of a doped-alumoxane. Upon thermolysis these doped-alumoxanes result in homogeneous mixed-metal oxides. The formation of single-phase materials is similar to that of traditional sol−gel methodologies; however, the alumoxane precursors are indefinitely stable, in solid and solution. In addition, these precursors show no propensity to segregation or polymerization and are readily processed in aqueous or hydrocarbon medium. The stability of the doped alumoxanes and uniformity of the subsequent oxide is a consequence of the atomic level mixing produced by a unique substitution reaction. A transition-metal or lanthanide ion is exchanged for an aluminum ion within the alumoxane nanoclusters and the elimination of Al3+ as Al(acac)3 or [Al(H2O)6]3+. Evidence for this reaction is obtained from NMR and IR spectroscopy. The doped-alumoxane precursors have been characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy and TG/DTA. The resulting mixed-metal oxide ceramics have been characterized by scanning electron and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ESR, microprobe analysis, and X-ray diffraction.",https://openalex.org/W1984943420,1996,Aivaras Kareiva; C.

Aluminum oxide/titanium dioxide nanolaminates grown by atomic layer deposition: Growth and mechanical properties,"Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is based on self-limiting surface reactions. This and cyclic process enable the growth of conformal thin films with precise thickness control and sharp interfaces. A multilayered thin film, which is nanolaminate, can be grown using ALD with tuneable electrical and optical properties to be exploited, for example, in the microelectromechanical systems. In this work, the tunability of the residual stress, adhesion, and mechanical properties of the ALD nanolaminates composed of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) films on silicon were explored as a function of growth temperature (110–300 °C), film thickness (20–300 nm), bilayer thickness (0.1–100 nm), and TiO2 content (0%–100%). Al2O3 was grown from Me3Al and H2O, and TiO2 from TiCl4 and H2O. According to wafer curvature measurements, Al2O3/TiO2 nanolaminates were under tensile stress; bilayer thickness and growth temperature were the major parameters affecting the stress; the residual stress decreased with increasing bilayer thickness and ALD temperature. Hardness increased with increasing ALD temperature and decreased with increasing TiO2 fraction. Contact modulus remained approximately stable. The adhesion of the nanolaminate film was good on silicon.",https://openalex.org/W2548089883,2016,Oili Ylivaara; Lauri Kilpi; Xuwen Liu,VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland; Aalto University
PLANT ROOT GROWTH IN ACID ANDOSOLS FROM NORTHEASTERN JAPAN,"This study was conducted to determine the properties of selected Andosols from northeastern Japan and the factors affecting the root growth of burdock, Arctium lappa cv. Takinogawa; barley, Hordeum vulgare cv. Norin-24; and orchard grass Dactylis glomerata cv. Kitamidori grown on these soils in a greenhouse. According to the clay mineralogical composition, the Andosol samples were divided into chloritized 2:1 mineral soils and allophane-imogolite1 soils. All the samples were poor in exchangeable bases, showed pH(H2O) ranging from 4.6 to 5.1, and were rich in reactive aluminum, as indicated by high pH(NaF), existence of large amounts of dithionite-citrate-soluble aluminum, and high phosphate absorption. On the other hand, a wide variation of exchange acidity Y1, determined by the titration of 125 ml of N KCl extract (soil: N KCL = 100:250) with 0.1 N NaOH, was observed; this was very large for chloritized 2:1 mineral soils and negligibly small for allophane-imogolite soils. Root growth of the test plants was reduced in chloritized 2:1 mineral soils, but not in allophane-imogolite soils. Morphological observation and aluminon test of the plant roots showed that aluminum toxicity occurred only in chloritized 2:1 mineral soils, even though all the soils contained large amounts of reactive aluminum and showed pH(H2O) range of 4.6 to 5.1. The degree of reduction of the root yields and the degree of aluminon reaction of aluminum-injured roots were in this order: burdock > barley > orchard grass. Examination of the properties of the soils sampled suggested that exchange acidity Y1 defined by Daikuhara (1914) was a realistic measure of aluminum toxicity potential in Andosols from northeastern Japan.",https://openalex.org/W1988849890,1980,Sadao Shoji; Masahiko Saigusa; Tadashi Takahashi,Tohoku University
Phase Equilibrium Study of the AlCl<sub>3</sub>–CaCl<sub>2</sub>–H<sub>2</sub>O System for the Production of Aluminum Chloride Hexahydrate from Ca-Rich Flue Ash,"The study of the solidliquid phase equilibrium for the AlCl3-CaCl2-H2O system is of significance to separate aluminum chloride hexahydrate from the leachate obtained by the reaction of Ca-rich fly ash and a waste hydrochloride from chemical plant. The phase equilibrium data for the binary AlCl3-H2O system and the ternary AlCl3-CaCl2-H(2)Osystem over the temperature range from 278.15 K to 363.15 K were measured. A rigorous and thermodynamically consistent model representing the AlCl3-CaCl2-H(2)Osystem developed on the basis of the Pitzers activity coefficient model embedded in the Aspen Plus. On the basis of this, the phase behavior of the ternary AlCl3-CaCl2-H2O system at different temperatures was visualized with lucidity on an equilateral triangle. The phase-equilibrium diagram generated by modeling was illustrated to identify the course of crystallization to recover AlCl3.6H(2)O from the solutions containing calcium chloride. All of these will provide a thermodynamic basis for the separation of aluminum chloride from calcium chloride solutions.",https://openalex.org/W2469928021,2015,Junfeng Wang; Camille Petit; Xiangping Zhang,Institute of Process Engineering; Imperial College London
TEM study of mullite growth after muscovite breakdown,"Mullite (Mul) formation after high-T muscovite (Ms) breakdown has been studied in phyllosilicaterich bricks. At T ≥ 900 °C Ms dehydroxylation is followed by partial melting that triggers the nucleation and growth of Mul acicular crystals. An analytical electron microscopy study reveals that the Mul is a 3:2-type with a [6](Al1.686Ti0.031Fe0.159Mg0.134)[4](Al2.360Si1.649)O9.82 formula and an O atom vacancy of x = 0.18. This is consistent with X-ray diffraction results [i.e., unit-cell parameters: a = 7.553(7), b = 7.694(7), and c = 2.881(1) Å, V = 167.45 Å3]. The initial stage of the process resulting in Mul growth followed the balanced reaction Ms → 0.275Mul + 0.667Melt + 0.244K2O + 0.01Na2O + 0.125H2O, yielding an alkali-poor peraluminous melt. H2O with K (and Na), which are lost along the (001) planes of dehydroxylated Ms, play a significant role as melting agents. The c-axes of the Mul crystals are oriented parallel to [010]ms or to the symmetrically equivalent <310>ms zone axis, while the (120)mul or (210)mul planes are subparallel to (001)ms (TEM results). These systematic orientations point to epitaxial Mul nucleation and growth on the remaining Ms substrate, which acts as a template for Mul heterogeneous nucleation. Randomly oriented Mul growth is also observed during the late stages of the process (i.e., melt cooling). The epitaxial nature of Mul growth after dehydroxylated Ms melting minimizes the energy requirement for nucleation. In addition, the water released after Ms breakdown and the multicomponent nature of the melt enable this high-T aluminum silicate to grow at T ~ 900 °C, almost 100 °C below the SiO2-Al2O3-K2O ternary system eutectic (after a melt with an end-member Ms composition).",https://openalex.org/W1902334635,2003,Carlos Rodríguez‐Navarro; Giuseppe Cultrone; Antonio Sánchez‐Navas,Universidad de Granada
The effects of reaction parameters on the deposition characteristics in Al2O3 CVD,"Deposits of aluminum oxides (Al2O3) have been formed by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique involving the application of gas mixtures of AlCl3, CO2, and H2 onto TiN coated cemented carbide substrates. The relationships between the deposition rate and various reaction parameters such as the gas flow rate, the deposition temperature, the composition of reactant gases, and the system pressure were studied. The CVD of Al2O3 is a thermally activated process and limited by the surface chemical reaction. The apparent activation energy is about 36 kcal/mol at 50 Torr and decreases with the increasing system pressure. The dependence of the deposition rate on the reactant gas composition is affected by the variation of the relative contents of the aluminum donor and the oxygen donor. At a low AlCl3 mole fraction, the deposition rate increases with the AlCl3 mole fraction; however, at higher AlCl3 mole fractions than 1.0×10−2 the deposition rate is mainly influenced by the H2O-forming reaction between CO2 and H2.",https://openalex.org/W1978979952,1983,Chulsoon Park; Jae Gon Kim; John S.

Mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>O Insertion and Chemical Bond Formation in AlPO<sub>4</sub>-54·<i>x</i>H<sub>2</sub>O at High Pressure,"The insertion of H2O in AlPO4-54·xH2O at high pressure was investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Monte Carlo molecular simulation. H2O molecules are concentrated, in particular, near the pore walls. Upon insertion, the additional water is highly disordered. Insertion of H2O (superhydration) is found to impede pore collapse in the material, thereby strongly modifying its mechanical behavior. However, instead of stabilizing the structure with respect to amorphization, the results provide evidence for the early stages of chemical bond formation between H2O molecules and tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum, which is at the origin of the amorphization/reaction process.",https://openalex.org/W2319081629,2015,Frederico Alabarse; Jérôme Rouquette; Benoît Coasne,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; Institut Charles Gerhardt Montpellier; Université de Montpellier
Simple model for atomic layer deposition precursor reaction and transport in a viscous-flow tubular reactor,"Precursor reaction and transport are both critical in determining the thickness uniformity and conformality of atomic layer deposition (ALD) thin films. However, it is sometimes difficult to predict how changes in conditions, such as mass flow rate or precursor reactivity, will affect the outcome of an ALD experiment. To provide some insight and guidance, we have developed a simple 1D model to describe precursor transport and reaction in a tubular viscous flow ALD reactor. After making some simplifying assumptions, we show that the transport problem depends only on three independent parameters, the Peclet number, the Damkoeler number, and the excess number, which can be easily calculated for most ALD processes. Despite its simplicity, we obtain very good agreement with experimental results for the thickness profiles of ALD Al2O3 films deposited using trimethyl aluminum and H2O. The authors have applied the model to study the impact of precursor properties and experimental conditions on the growth profiles and saturation curves obtained during ALD, including the presence of nonself-limited wall recombination.",https://openalex.org/W2000314470,2011,Ángel Yanguas-Gil; Jeffrey W.

"Mechanism and Reactivity of Alkane C−H Bond Dissociation on Coordinatively Unsaturated Aluminum Ions, Determined by Theoretical Calculations","DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level were conducted on the reaction of the propane molecule with the aluminum hydroxide clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0,1). Weak, physisorbed (van der Waals) complexes were identified. Chemisorption does not involve the Brønsted acidity of the catalyst, as no hydron transfer occurs. Instead, the reaction involves insertion of the aluminum atom into a C−H bond, followed by the migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen, to form the chemisorbed intermediate, (H2O)x+1(HO)2Al−CH2Et or (H2O)x+1(HO)2Al−CHMe2, with the latter having a higher energy barrier. The elimination of hydrogen from Cβ and oxygen gives then H2 and propene, which forms a strong π complex with the aluminum cluster for x = 0. The first step, chemisorption, has a lower energy barrier than the second, elimination, but still higher than the hydrogen dissociation on the same clusters. Thus, the rate relationship H2/D2 exchange > H2/RH exchange > RH dehydrogenation is predicted, as was experimentally observed. The tetracoordinated aluminum cluster (x = 1) reacts with the hydrocarbon by the same pathway as the tricoordinated aluminum cluster (x = 0) but with higher barriers for both steps; the barriers are reduced for the larger cluster (HO)2(H2O)Al−O−Al(OH)2(H2O). The alternative pathway, forming the alkyl−oxygen adduct (HO)2Al(OH2)x(H)−O(R)H is too high in energy to compete. Examination of butane and isobutane establishes the reactivity order: prim C−H > sec-C−H > tert-C−H. For isobutane, essentially only methyl C−H cleavage should occur in the common first step for hydrogen exchange and dehydrogenation. In the second step, i.e., the β C−H cleavage in the Al-alkyl intermediate, the reactivity order is tert-C−H > sec-C−H > prim C−H. ""Broken lattice"" zeolites and especially extraframework aluminum species present in steamed zeolites should be more reactive than the intact zeolite lattices. Thus, the mechanism is relevant for the activation of alkanes for acid-catalyzed conversions on these catalysts, which have insufficient acid strength to cleave C−H and C−C bonds by hydron transfer.",https://openalex.org/W2011464234,2002,Dan Fǎrcaşiu; Povilas Lukinskas,University of Pittsburgh
"Environment, Stability and Acidity of External Surface Sites of Silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 Micro and Nano Slabs, Sheets, and Crystals","Zeolites are nanoporous aluminosilicate crystals of prominent fundamental and industrial importance. Among these, ZSM-5 is the most investigated solid that can be obtained in various forms, with some of these (hierarchical forms, nanoslabs, nanosheets, and nanocrystals) exhibiting a very high external surface to volume ratio. Whereas most knowledge obtained so far at the atomic level concerns the internal nanopores, we here propose a density functional theory (DFT) study to establish the relative stability of relevant surface orientations for silicalite and ZSM-5 crystals ((100), (010), and (101)) at different hydration levels to identify the equilibrium morphology of the particles and the major sites present on their surfaces. Several kinds of surface sites have been identified. Bridging Al–OH–Si groups are present at the pore mouth with stability similar to or higher than those in bulk sites. Yet, these groups are not stable at the outermost surface, where the following groups prevail: Si–OH, Al–OH groups, and most importantly water adsorbed on aluminum, Al–(H2O)(OH) n . Water desorption reactions occur at temperatures that strongly depend on the local topology of the surface site and on the surface orientation: when a siloxane bridge is present below the surface Al atom, water desorption is promoted by the formation of an additional Al–O bond with the oxygen of the siloxane bridge. However, if such a bridge is not present below the surface aluminum atom, desorption leads to a less stable surface AlIII atom. The desorption temperature is influenced by this feature, as well as by the stabilization of the water molecule by hydrogen bonds, depending on the silanol content of the surface. This has in turn direct consequences on the Brønsted and Lewis acid properties, as probed by pyridine. Strong Lewis acid sites can easily be formed on the (010) orientation (relevant for nanosheets), whereas they are unlikely to occur at the (101) surface (tips of coffin-shaped particles), which promotes the mild Brønsted acid sites Al–(H2O) instead.",https://openalex.org/W3002463467,2020,Laureline Treps; Axel Gomez; Theodorus de Bruin,IFP Énergies nouvelles; Université Paris Sciences et Lettres; École Normale Supérieure - PSL
Surface Complexation and Precipitation at the H<sup>+</sup>−Orthophosphate−Aged γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Water Interface,"Surface complexation of orthophosphate ions at the water-suspended-and-aged gamma-Al2O3/water interface has been studied by means of a series of batch experiments in 0.1 M Na(Cl) medium at 25.0 degrees C in the range 4.8 &lt; -log [H+] &lt; 9.6. The ratio between phosphate concentration and concentration of surface active groups (=AlOH) was varied between 0.15 and 1.50. The suspensions were equilibrated for 5 h, and experimental data consisted of measured -log [H+] and nonbound phosphate analyses. The orthophosphate ions were found to bind to the surface with high affinity at -log [H+] &lt; 7.5. In the data evaluation, contributions from electrostatic forces were accounted for by using the constant-capacitance model. The acid/base properties of the hydroxylated alumina surface (=AlOH) have been investigated earlier and are described by two intrinsic equilibrium constants, log beta(110) = 7.51 and log beta(-110) = -8.87 and with a specific capacitance of 1.40 F/m(2). The model describing the phosphate complexation to the alumina surface is given by the following equilibria: =AlOH + H2PO4- + H+ reversible arrow =AlPO4H2 + H2O (log beta(111(int)) = 11.49 +/- 0.08); =AlOH + H2PO4- reversible arrow =AlPO4H- + H2O (log beta(011(int)) = 5.14 +/- 0.07); =AlOH + H2PO4- reversible arrow =AlPO42- + H+ + H2O (log beta(-111(int)) = -1.82 +/- 0.04). The uncertainties reported correspond to 3 sigma(log beta). In the presence of excess phosphate and at extended equilibration periods, a slow continuing decrease in nonbound phosphate concentration was observed. By means of diffuse reflectance FTIR measurements, this phenomenon was shown to be caused by a slow transformation into an aluminum phosphate solid phase. The surface complexation reactions evaluated in this work should therefore be regarded as a metastable state, strictly valid only in freshly prepared suspensions. However, FTIR data collected at deficit phosphate conditions indicate that this phase transformation is hardly noticeable unless an excess of ligand was introduced to the system. This implies that the presented semiequilibrium model is likely to provide a thermodynamic description of the equilibria in the system for [H2PO4-](tot)/[=AlOH](tot) &lt; 1.",https://openalex.org/W1983613630,1996,Erkki Laiti; Per Persson; Lars-Olof Öhman,Umeå University
Hydrothermal Synthesis and Characterization of Aluminum-Free Mn-β Zeolite: A Catalyst for Phenol Hydroxylation,"Zeolite beta, especially heteroatomic zeolite beta, has been widely used in the industries of fine chemicals and petroleum refining because of its outstanding thermal stability, acid resistance, and unique 3-D open-frame structure. In this paper, aluminum-free Mn-β zeolite was hydrothermally synthesized in the SiO2-MnO2-(TEA)2O-NaF-H2O system. The effect of the chemical composition of the precursor mixture to the crystallization of the Al-free Mn-β zeolite was investigated. The synthesized Al-free Mn-β zeolite was characterized by inductively coupled plasma (ICP), XRD, thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), N2 adsorption-desorption, FT-IR, UV-vis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the synthesized zeolite has a structure of β zeolite with good crystallinity and Mn ions present in the framework of the zeolite. The synthesized Al-free Mn-β zeolite shows great catalytic activity toward the phenol hydroxylation reaction using H2O2 as the oxidant. Approximately 35% of phenol conversion and ∼98% of dihydroxybenzene selectivity can be obtained under the optimal conditions.",https://openalex.org/W2321614393,2015,Zhen He; Wu Juan; Bingying Gao,Central South University; Hunan Normal University
"Noble‐Metal Nanotubes (Pt, Pd, Ag) from Lyotropic Mixed‐Surfactant Liquid‐Crystal Templates","Platinum, palladium, and silver nanotubes of 6–7-nm outer diameters are synthesized by the reduction of metal salts confined to lyotropic mixed-surfactant liquid crystals (see picture). The lyotropic liquid crystals act as a template and are formed by the 1:1 combination of medium and large surfactant molecules into a hexagonal array of cylindrical rodlike micelles. A lot of attention is currently focused on nanosized tubular materials because of their unique physical properties and potential applications as gas and fluid paths or reservoirs in catalysis, fuel cells, sensors, and separation systems.1 Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes,2 there have been reports on a variety of inorganic nanotubes based on boron nitride,3 metal sulfides,4 metal borates5 and metal oxides.6 Besides high-temperature processes,2–5 another approach that makes use of solid or molecular templates6 has been developed for the synthesis of such nanotubular materials. For metals important in catalysis and other nanotechnological fields, synthesis by using nanoporous polymer and anodic aluminum films as templates led to gold,7a nickel,7b and palladium7c nanotubes, but with inner diameters as large as 10–100 nm. Furthermore, no report has appeared on the fabrication of metal nanotubes by using a surfactant or other molecular templates, although mesoporous platinum was obtained by using the lyotropic liquid crystals (LCs) of nonionic surfactants.8 In brief, the previous templating approaches to metals yielded only nanoporous materials or thick-walled tubular structures. This fact seems to suggest that thin-walled metal nanotubes with diameters below 10 nm might be unobtainable because of their extremely high surface energies, in spite of their potentially attractive functionalities, as expected by analogy with the magnetically and catalytically unique properties of platinum nanowires.9 The previous surfactant templating process that was first applied to the synthesis of mesoporous silica MCM-4,10 used almost exclusively a single ionic or nonionic surfactant. In contrast, our recent study revealed that the lyotropic nematic media of nonionic–cationic mixed surfactant are effective for the preparation of tin oxide microwires.11 This motivated us to apply such a mixed surfactant template to the fabrication of nanostructured metals. Herein we demonstrate the first synthesis of platinum, palladium, and silver nanotubes, with inner diameters of 3–4 nm and outer diameters of 6–7 nm, by the reduction of metal salts confined to lyotropic mixed LCs of two different sized surfactants. The mechanism of formation of such metal nantubes is also proposed. In the typical fabrication process, the liquid crystalline phase of hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6), nonaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12EO9), polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60) and water at a molar ratio of 1:1:1:60 was treated with hydrazine. The transmission electron-microscope (TEM) image of the resulting black powders showed an aggregate of nanotubular materials (Figure 1 A). Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the reduced powders confirmed the existence of platinum as the major component and the complete removal of chloride ions librated during the reduction of platinum ions into platinum metal. Hence, the tubular materials thus obtained can be identified as platinum nanotubes with inner and outer diameters of 3 and 6 nm, respectively. Some round spots with a diameter of about 6 nm are observed in the same image because some of the folded nanotubes are oriented parallel to the electron beam. The length of nanotubes is estimated to be much greater than 100 nm, but it is impossible to determine the total length of an isolated nanotube because the nanotubular materials are highly cohered into a dense aggregate. The X-ray-diffraction (XRD) pattern of the reduced solid also exhibited a broad shoulder at 2θ=0.5–2° that is presumably due to the nanotubular structure (Figure 2). The two broad peaks at 2θ=39.73° and 46.19° are assigned to the (111) and (200) reflections, respectively, of the fcc structure with a unit cell parameter of 0.3929 nm, which is very close to that of the bulk metal (0.3923 nm). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and FTIR spectroscopy revealed that the solid contains ≈36 wt % of remaining surfactant species, which suggests that the nanotubular platinum particles are stabilized by the remaining organic species. An additional experiment showed that the organic content is further decreased to ≈13 wt % by treatment with an ethanol solution of sodium acetate. The catalytic activities of platinum nanotubes would not always be lowered by surfactant or other molecular protection, as various noble metal colloids stabilized by surfactants and solvents were demonstrated to be effective for hydrogenation12 and use in the Heck reaction.13 TEM images showing A) platinum, B) palladium, and C) silver nanotubes obtained by reducing their precursory mixed surfactant LC phases with hydrazine. XRD pattern of the as-grown platinum nanotube obtained by the hydrazine treatment. A similar reaction by using Pd(NO3)2 in place of H2PtCl6 also yielded palladium nanotubes with inner and outer diameters of 3 and 6 nm, respectively (Figure 1 B). Another fabrication process that uses sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and Tween 60 as a mixed template with AgNO3 resulted in the formation of an aggregate of silver nanotubes with inner and outer diameters 4 and 7 nm, respectively (Figure 1 C). It is noted throughout the above three systems that the metal nanotubes are highly cohered into a dense aggregate. This aggregation, together with the stability of electron-beam system, which was affected by the organic species evaporated from the metal samples placed in the vacuum chamber of TEM, led to difficulties in observing a higher resolution image of an isolated metal nanotube. According to TGA, palladium nanotubes washed with ethanol were three times less contaminated with remaining organic materials than the platinum nanotubes, and hence the former metal particles tended to form more dense aggregates. This may be the reason why the TEM image of palladium is a little less clear than that of platinum as observed in Figure 1. In marked contrast to the above observations, no nanotubular metals were obtained when the reaction was performed by using any one of C12EO9, SDS, and Tween 60 as the sole templating agent. These facts clearly indicate that mixed-surfactant LCs based on Tween 60 are essential to the preparation of noble-metal nanotubes. It is therefore particularly intriguing to elucidate the pathway from the precursory mixture to the formation of nanotubes and the factor that determines their dimensions. For this report, we focused our attention on the characterization of the precursory LC in the H2PtCl6/C12EO9/Tween 60/H2O system. The XRD patterns of the C12EO9/Tween 60/H2O mixtures at a molar ratio of 1:y:60 exhibited one major peak around 2θ=1.5° and a very weak broad band near 2θ=2.5° (Figure 3 A). These two peaks are attributed to the 100 and 110 reflections for a hexagonal structure with a≈7 nm. Similarly to the C12EO8/H2O14 and C16EO8/H2O8a, 14b LCs, the C12EO9/H2O (y=0) mixture also forms a hexagonal phase with a=6.82 nm. No layered-phase characteristic of the binary Tween 60/H2O system is observed for the y=0–2 compositions. It is also remarked that even upon addition of much larger surfactant molecules, the hexagonal structure is maintained over a wide range of y=0–1.6 while keeping the parameter a in the narrow range of 6.8–7.2 nm. More interestingly, the parameter a, which corresponds to the rod-to-rod distance in an array of cylindrical rodlike micelles, varies in a sine-wave with the Tween 60 content y and has a minimum of a=6.9 nm at y≈1 (Figure 3 C). These findings suggest that C12EO9 and Tween 60 surfactant molecules, which are very different in size, mix at the molecular level to form a hexagonal array of cylindrical micelles and that their equimolar composition may afford the most dense or stabilized phase. When H2PtCl6 was added to the y=1 hexagonal composition, the XRD peaks of the resulting phases showed a marked tendency to decrease in intensity with increasing platinum content x (Figure 3 B). Thus, the precursory 1:1:1:60 phase that contained the PtCl62− ion could be identified as an LC with a hexagonal but disordered array of mixed surfactant cylindrical micelles corresponding to a=6.9 nm. XRD patterns of A) the 1:y: 60 mixtures of C12EO9, Tween 60 and H2O and B) the x:1:1:60 mixtures of H2PtCl6, C12EO9, Tween 60 and H2O at ≈15 °C (CuKα), and C) plots of the rod-to-rod distance, a, as a function of Tween 60 content, y, for the former ternary mixtures. On the basis of the above X-ray observations along with the structural parameters of surfactant molecules (Table 1), we proposed a structure model for the precursory 1:1:1:60 LC (Figure 4 A). This model is based on a structural calculation done by assuming that equimolar amounts of C12EO9 and Tween 60 molecules are arranged side by side with their hydrophobic tail groups fully extended and tilted at the same angle to form a cylindrical rodlike micelle; their hydrophilic heads are assumed to be directed to the outside and the rodlike micelles further assembled into a hexagonal array with a rod-to-rod distance equal to the observed value of 6.9 nm.15 Additionally, the hydrophilic head groups of both surfactant molecules were assumed to adopt a spherical conformation with the same packing coefficient of 0.681 as observed for a number of amorphous or poorly crystalline polymers.16 The structural calculations also indicated that the surfactant molecules in the mixed surfactant LC are much less tilted with respect to the rod axis than those in the hexagonal LC of C12EO9 (Figure 4 B). Thus, we supposed that the present platinum nanotubes are formed by a mixed surfactant templating mechanism (Figure 4 C). In this mechanism, the rodlike micelles of C12EO9 molecules in an aqueous medium are combined with much larger-sized sorbitan-based non-ionic surfactant molecules (Tween 60) to form an aqueous solution of the mixed surfactant cylindrical micelles as described above. On cooling the mixed micellar solution would be converted into a hexagonal LC with a=6.9 nm. At the final stage, the platinum species confined to the aqueous region of the molecular assemblies are reduced into platinum atoms. Schematic models for the formation of platinum nanotubes in the mixed surfactant templating system: A) Mixed (C12EO9/Tween 60) and B) single (C12EO9) surfactant cylindrical rodlike micelles. C) Pathway from micellar solution to metal nanotubes by the reduction of metals salts confined to the aqueous shell of mixed-surfactant cylindrical micelles. The metal salts and water molecules are omitted from the models. Surfactant Head group Tail group Molecule Effect. Volume Diameter Volume Length Volume Length Vh,i [nm3][b] Dh,i [nm] Vt,i [nm3] Lt,i [nm] Vm,i [nm3] Lm,i [nm] C12EO9 0.589 1.04 0.214 1.61 0.803 2.65 Tween 60 1.299 1.30 0.324 2.53 1.623 3.88 The observed inner diameter of 3 nm for both the platinum and palladium nanotubes agrees closely with 3.1 nm calculated for the diameter of the hydrophobic core of the mixed surfactant micelle (Table 2). This is because the reduced metal is stabilized at the interface between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic domains, as Attard et al. explained the formation of HI-platinum from a hexagonal LC of C16EO8.8a The subsequent process, however, is remarkably different between both systems. In the mixed-surfactant system, the reduced metal grows into nanotubes with a wall-thickness of 1.5 nm within the cylindrical micelle because the aqueous shell has a maximum thickness of 1.93 nm according to the calculation (Table 2). In contrast, the aqueous shells in the C16EO8 and the C12EO9 systems are as thin as 1.0 nm. The insufficient thickness for the separate growth of nanotubes would lead to mesoporous or bulk metals as a result of agglomeration and coalescence of metal clusters deposited within neighboring micelles, as observed for these single-surfactant systems. A similar mechanism would apply to the Ag-based system. A preliminary experiment showed that the 1:1:1:60 composition of AgNO3/SDS/Tween 60/water is also a hexagonal LC with a=7.03 nm close to that for the platinum system. The observed inner diameter of 4 nm for the silver nanotube (larger than 3 nm for the other two metals) may be due to an increase in the effective diameter of hydrophobic core by the coulomb-repulsive effect of the sulfate group bonded to the dodecyl chain. Surfactant Number of molecules Diameter Thickness per cross section N of core of shell Dc [nm] δ [nm] C12EO9 17 4.73 1.04 C12EO8 21 5.72 1.00 C12EO9/Tween 60 12/12 3.12 1.93 In summary, the reduction of metal salts confined to lyotropic mixed surfactant LCs resulted in the first synthesis of platinum, palladium, and silver nanotubes of 6–7 nm outer diameter. Equimolar amounts of medium and large surfactant molecules are combined into a hexagonal array of cylindrical rodlike micelles ≈6.9 nm in diameter and the aqueous outer shell of the rodlike micelles is so thick that the reduced metal grows into nanotubes separately within the aqueous shell. This can be explained by a structure model constructed on the basis of the molecular parameters of surfactants along with X-ray observations. The uniformly sized platinum and the other two metal nanotubes are promising for potential applications as electrodes in batteries and fuel cells, environmental catalysts, and electronic nanodevices. The mixed surfactant templating method could also be extended to the synthesis of a wide range of nanotubular materials, inorganic or organic. A mixture of H2PtCl6, C12EO9, Tween 60, and H2O in a 1:1:1:60 molar ratio was shaken at 60 °C, then cooled to between 15 and 25 °C and allowed to stand at that temperature for 30 min. Polarizing optical microscopy revealed that the homogeneous mixture was an isotropic solution at 60 °C and transformed around 28 °C into a LC phase. An excess amount of hydrazine was added to the cooled (25 °C) pasty material and then kept at that temperature for 24 h. The resulting solid was separated, washed with water and then repeatedly with ethanol prior to drying in air. Similar syntheses by using Pd(NO3)2, or AgNO3, SDS, and in place of H2PtCl6 and C12EO9 were carried out to obtain palladium and silver nanotubes. To characterize the precursory LC phases, pasty mixed phases of C12EO9, Tween 60, and H2O with different compositions were also prepared by using the same heating and cooling processes as above. All TEM images were taken with a Hitachi H-800 MU microscope operated at 200 keV. Wide-angle XRD patterns were measured by the reflectance method using CuKα radiation, and small angle ones for pasty or powdered samples were measured by the transmission method on a Shimadzu XRD-7000 diffractometer equipped with a glass plate of 1 mm thick with a slit of 1 mm wide filled with specimen.

An Ionicity Rationale to Design Solid phase Metal Nitride Reactants for Solar Ammonia Production,"Ammonia provides the basis of nutrition for a large portion of the human population on earth and could be used additionally as a convenient hydrogen carrier. This work studies a solar thermochemical reaction cycle that separates the reductive N2 cleavage from the hydrogenation of nitrogen ions to NH3 without using electricity or fossil fuel. The hydrolysis of binary metal nitrides of magnesium, aluminum, calcium, chromium, manganese, zinc, or molybdenum at 0.1 MPa and 200–1000 °C recovered up to 100 mol % of the lattice nitrogen with up to 69.9 mol % as NH3 liberated at rates of up to 1.45 × 10–3 mol NH3 (mol metal)−1 s–1 for ionic nitrides. These rates and recoveries are encouraging when extrapolated to a full scale process. However, nitrides with lower ionicity are attractive due to simplified reduction conditions to recycle the oxidized reactant after NH3 formation. For these materials diffusion in the solid limits the rate of NH3 liberation. The nitride ionicity (9.96–68.83% relative to an ideal ionic solid) was found to correlate with the diffusion constants (6.56 × 10–14 to 4.05 × 10–7 cm2 s–1) suggesting that the reduction of H2O over nitrides yielding NH3 is governed by the activity of the lattice nitrogen or ion vacancies, respectively. The ionicity appears to be a useful rationale when developing an atomic-scale understanding of the solid-state reaction mechanism and when designing prospectively optimized ternary nitrides for producing NH3 more sustainably and at mild conditions compared to the Haber Bosch process.",https://openalex.org/W2128009295,2012,Ronald Michalsky; Peter H.

Adsorption and Reaction of Water on the AlN(0001) Surface from First Principles,"Aluminum nitride (AlN) with a combination of very high thermal conductivity and excellent electrical insulation properties exhibits wide applications. However, it is quite sensitive to a moist environment and hydrolyzes slowly in water. In this work, density functional theory was adopted to examine the atomistic reaction mechanism on the wurtzite AlN(0001) surface. The results indicate that water molecules are preferentially adsorbed at the top site of the AlN(0001) surface. The decomposition of adsorbed H2O into OH and H on the AlN(0001) surface occurs spontaneously without any energy barrier. However, a further dissociation reaction of OH into O and H has an energy barrier of 22.046 kcal/mol. The dissociation of H2O is strongly dependent on the H2O coverage when more water molecules are adsorbed. Ammonia (NH3) is determined as the dominant gas product at 4/9 monolayer H2O coverage, which will induce N vacancy (VN) formation in AlN ceramic. The VN will be occupied by O2– after geometry optimization and plays an acceleration role in the degradation of AlN by water. H2O adsorption and the formation of NH3 occur alternately with the H2O coverage increasing. An OH–Al–O layer is formed as a precursor of AlOOH after the first AlN bilayer is fully degraded. This work can guide the manufacture and application of AlN from the theoretical viewpoint.",https://openalex.org/W2914141729,2019,Yafeng Chen; Xinmei Hou; Zhi Fang,University of Science and Technology Beijing
Synthesis and Characterization of High Aluminum Zeolite X from Technical Grade Materials,"Zeolites are widely used as ion exchangers, adsorbents, separation materials and catalyst due to their well-tailored and highly-reproducible structures; therefore, the synthesis of zeolite from low grade resources can be interested. In the present work, high aluminum zeolite X was prepared from mixing technical grade sodium aluminate and sodium silicate solutions at temperatures between 70°C and 100°C. The synthesized zeolite X was characterized by SEM and X-ray methods according to ASTM standard procedures. The results showed that aging of the synthesis medium at the room temperature considerably increased the selectivity of zeolite X formation. On the other hand, high temperature of reaction mixture during crystallization formed zeolite A in the product; therefore, it decreased the purity of zeolite X. In addition, it was found that increasing H2O/Na2O and decreasing Na2O/SiO2 molar ratios in the reaction mixture resulted product with higher purity. © 2013 by Authors, Published by BCREC Group.

Reaction of Aluminum Cluster Cations with a Mixture of O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O Gases: Formation of Hydrated-Alumina Clusters,"We present reactions of size-selected free aluminum cluster cations, AlN+ (N = 1–14), exposed to a mixture of water and oxygen gases. It is featured that chemical species assignable to Al2O6H7+ and Al2O7H9+ were commonly produced as prominent reaction products from all of the sizes, except N = 1. These product ions were found to be produced via the formation of Al2O3+ in the initial stage of reactions with O2 and H2O, which was followed by successive hydrogenation and hydration. This reaction pathway was identified by examining reactivity of each intermediate product step by step. Structures of the product ions were analyzed by collision-induced dissociation experiments and DFT calculations; for example, coexistence of isomers, Al2O5H5(H2O)+ and Al2O4H3(H2O)2+, with one and two intact H2O molecules, respectively, was suggested for Al2O6H7+. The chemical compositions of the ions produced in the present reactions are expressed nominally as Al2O3(H2O)nH+, which is similar, except for the proton, to that of hydrated alumina, that is, forms of bulk aluminum abundant naturally. The present finding gives molecular-level insights into formation processes of aluminum minerals in a natural environment.",https://openalex.org/W2314426754,2014,Masashi Arakawa; Kei Kohara; Akira Terasaki,Kyushu University
In Situ Synthesis and Performance of Aluminum Fumarate Metal–Organic Framework Monolithic Adsorbent for Water Adsorption,"The monolithic adsorbent is a key part of an adsorptive rotary dehumidification system. It is usually prepared by dip-coating the adsorbent on glass fiber paper. In this study, a new in situ strategy for synthesis of an aluminum fumarate (A520) metal–organic framework monolithic adsorbent on glass fiber paper is introduced. The influences of the mole ratio of fumaric acid to H2O, the reaction temperature and time on the crystal phase, the pore structure, and the adsorption performance of the monolithic adsorbent are systematically discussed. The morphology of the adsorbent was characterized by scanning electronic microscopy, and the adsorption and desorption performances were evaluated by dynamic vapor sorption and differential thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that under the conditions of a mole ratio of fumaric acid to H2O of 0.02, reaction temperature of 50 °C, and reaction time of 60 min, the obtained A520 monolith exhibited the highest BET surface area (740.15 m2·g–1) and high adsorption capacity (0.3906 g·g–1). The monolithic adsorbent carries about 76% A520 powder with the advantages of a facile fabrication process, high adsorption capacity, rapid adsorption rate, and low desorption temperature, providing guidance for the fabrication of a highly efficient desiccant dehumidification wheel.",https://openalex.org/W2964481000,2019,Bingqiong Tan; Yanshu Luo; Xianghui Liang,South China University of Technology
Atomic oxygen-metal surface studies as applied to mass spectrometer measurements of upper planetary atmospheres,"An atomic oxygen beam and mass spectrometer were used to measure the oxygen atom reflection γ16, recombination γ32, general surface reaction γM, and occlusion γ0 probabilities on six different engineering surfaces as a function of atomic oxygen exposure. The materials studied include gold, Nichrome V, aluminum, titanium, silver, and platinum. The reflection probability was seen to range from an initial total loss (at time of exposure equal to zero) on aluminum, titanium, and platinum to an observed maximum of 0.65 on titanium after 8.5 h of exposure. Recombination was seen on all surfaces except aluminum and platinum, the maximum recombination probability γ32 being 0.27 on gold after 19 h of exposure.

Growth and electrical properties of AlOx grown by mist chemical vapor deposition,"Aluminum oxide (AlOx) thin films were grown using aluminum acetylacetonate (Al(acac)3) as a source solute by mist chemical vapor deposition (mist CVD). The AlOx thin films grown at temperatures above 400°C exhibited a breakdown field (EBD) over 6 MV/cm and a dielectric constant (κ) over 6. It is suggested that residual OH bonding in the AlOx thin films grown at temperatures below 375°C caused degradation of the breakdown field (EBD). With FC type mist CVD, the reaction proceeded efficiently (Ea = 22–24 kJ/mol) because the solvent, especially H2O, worked as a stronger oxygen source. The AlOx film could be grown at 450°C with a high deposition rate (23 nm/min) and smooth surface (RMS = 1.5 nm). Moreover, the AlOx thin films grown by mist CVD had excellent practicality as insulators because the gate leakage current (IG) of the oxide thin film transistor (TFT) with an IGZO/AlOx stack was suppressed below 1 pA at a gate voltage (VG) of 20 V.",https://openalex.org/W1993236756,2013,Toshiyuki Kawaharamura; Takayuki Uchida; Masaru Sanada,Kochi University of Technology
Hydroxylation of Ultrathin Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/NiAl(110) Films at Environmental Humidity,"We have investigated the reaction of ultrathin Al2O3/NiAl(110) films with water vapor from ultrahigh vacuum to relative humidities (RH) up to 10%, over the temperature range from −5 to 65 °C, using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The APXPS experiments show a sharp onset of oxide/hydroxide film growth at ∼0.01% RH, coupled with an increase of the oxygen-to-aluminum ratio, most likely because of the adsorption of OH and H2O species at the oxide surface and their reaction with Al from the NiAl substrate, which leads to a thickening of the oxide film at RH > 0.01%. The STM measurements support the results from APXPS and reveal a change in surface morphology when the Al2O3/NiAl(110) sample was exposed to relative humidities greater than 0.01%.",https://openalex.org/W2319997715,2014,Andrey Shavorskiy; Kathrin Müller; John T.

"Acrylic Acid Production by Gas-Phase Dehydration of Lactic Acid over K<sup>+</sup>-Exchanged ZSM-5: Reaction Variable Effects, Kinetics, and New Evidence for Cooperative Acid–Base Bifunctional Catalysis","This study investigates the effects of reaction variables (including space velocity, temperature, and partial pressures of LA and H2O) and acidic and basic additives on the gas-phase dehydration of lactic acid (LA) for acrylic acid (AA) production, using an aluminum-rich K+-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite (molar SiO2/Al2O3 = 27, K/Al = 1.0, K/Na = 8) identified among many high-silica zeolites as the most efficient catalyst in our prior work (Yan et al. ACS Catal. 2017, 7, 538−550). Under widely varied reaction conditions (340–380 °C, feed GHSV: 9,500–38,000 h–1, 1.8–11.7 kPa LA, 52.0–73.0 kPa H2O), the catalyst offers not only high selectivity for AA (>75 mol %) but also long-term catalytic stability. Rate equations and their associated kinetic parameters for LA consumption and AA production are obtained by measuring the kinetically relevant catalytic rates under high feed space velocity (GHSV ≥ 57,000 h–1). Acidic (CO2, acetic acid, and trifluoroacetic acid) and basic (NH3) additives are added, respectively, to the reaction feed to investigate their effects on performance of the working catalyst. While addition of either CO2 or acetic acid shows no effect on the catalyst performance, the addition of either NH3 or trifluoroacetic acid causes significant decline in both the catalyst activity and selectivity for AA production, due to poisoning of the surface acidic sites by NH3 or basic sites by trifluoroacetic acid. These data well highlight the excellent catalytic performance of the investigated catalyst and offer a new piece of evidence in support of the cooperative acid–base bifunctional catalysis for the LTA reaction.",https://openalex.org/W3043574677,2020,Bo Yan; Zonghui Liu; Liang Yu,Tsinghua University
Aluminum Dihydroxide with Terminal OH Groups: An Unprecedented Congener of Boronic Acid,"A synthetic approach to [LAl(OH)2] (L=HC{(CMe)(2,6-iPr2C6H3N)}2) is described. A novel congener of boronic acid, the single-crystal X-ray structure of the complex is shown to be a dimer (see picture) displaying short AlOH bonds, and exhibiting interdimer hydrogen bonding, the origin of which has been discerned by theoretical and spectroscopic analysis. Alumoxanes as highly active catalysts and cocatalysts are of tremendous importance for the polymerization of a wide range of organic monomers.1 Compounds of the general formula [RAlO]n or [R2AlOAlR2]n can be regarded as intermediates in the hydrolysis of aluminum compounds to aluminum hydroxide, which are prepared by the controlled reaction of aluminum compounds with water2 or reactive oxygen-containing species.3 In the course of numerous investigations of the controlled hydrolysis of aluminum compounds, some alumoxanes with bridged or capped OH groups have been isolated and structurally characterized.4 Although the organic or organically modified terminal aluminum hydroxides are very rare, the hydrolysis of trimesitylaluminum was accomplished in a controlled reaction involving THF as a coordinating solvent.5 Nonetheless, alkyl alumoxanes with the general formula [R2AlOLi]n (n=2, 3, 4) have been obtained by using anhydrous lithium hydroxide instead of water, or by deprotonation of the hydroxide [R2AlOH]n with tBuLi or MeLi.6 Our recent demonstration that the liquid ammonia/toluene two-phase system is highly effective for the hydrolysis and ammonolysis of transition-metal compounds has led to the preparation of the organozirconium oxide and hydroxide clusters [{(EtMe4C5)Zr}6(μ6-O)(μ3-O)8]⋅C7H8, [{(EtMe4C5)Zr}6(μ6-O)(μ3-O)8]⋅C9H12,7 [{(Me5C5)Zr}6(μ4-O)(μ-O)4(μ-OH)8]⋅2 C7H8,8 and related systems.9 Herein we report the first hydrolysis of a main-group-metal halide using an aluminum compound supported by a β-diketiminato ligand in a two-phase system. Treatment of [LAlI2] (1; L=HC{(CMe)(2,6-iPr2C6H3N)}2) with KOH containing 10–15 % H2O (1:1.3 molar ratio of pure KOH) and KH (1:0.7 molar ratio) in liquid ammonia and toluene at −78 °C results in the complete removal of iodide and the formation of the aluminum dihydroxide [LAl(OH)2] (2; Scheme 1). A proposed mechanism for the formation of 2 is given in Equations (1)–(7) in Scheme 2 . The rapid initial reactions are the coordination of water [Eq. (1)] and the formation of NH4I [Eq. (2)]; the latter species was converted to KI [Eq. (4)]. Further hydrolysis of 4 led to the intermediates 5 and 6 [Eqs. (5) and (6)], which yields 2 after the complete release of the coordinated ammonia molecules [Eq. (7)]. It has been well documented that the hydrolysis of alkyl aluminum compounds generates aluminum–water adducts [R3Al⋅OH2].5 A similar mechanism was reported for the ammonolysis of aluminum triiodide in the presence of K or KNH2 in liquid ammonia, which results in the formation of aluminum amides.10 In contrast, the reaction of [LAlH2] with H2O in THF or toluene does not isolate 2, but instead leads to complete hydrolysis, which yielded an insoluble aluminum oxide or hydroxide, and the LH ligand. The Lewis acidity of the intermediates 3–6 is considerably decreased because of presence of coordinatively saturated aluminum centers in proximity with the donor ammonia molecules. Consequently, the aluminum compounds undergo hydrolysis to form the Brønsted-acidic aluminum hydroxide in liquid ammonia. In addition, the reaction occurring preferentially at the interface can be rationalized as the two-phase system (ammonia/toluene) increases the solubility of the organic and inorganic components. Therefore, we believe that the liquid ammonia/toluene two-phase system is essential for the formation of 2, and the bulky L ligand on the aluminum center serves to stabilize the dihydroxide complex. Ar=2,6-iPr2C6H3 Compound 2 is a colorless crystalline solid that decomposes above 140 °C. However, no decomposition or polymerization was observed when 2 was kept in toluene solution, or in the solid state in a dry-box. The most intense peak in the EI mass spectrum of 2 appeared at m/z 403 [M+−Me−iPr−OH], and the signal at m/z 478 (14 %) was assigned to the molecular ion [M+]. Single crystals of 211 suitable for X-ray structural analysis were obtained by maintaining the reaction mixture in toluene/hexane at −20 °C for one week. Compound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. Hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl H atom of one molecule and the hydroxyl O atom of another molecule results in a dimeric structure for 2 with a centrosymmetric planar eight-membered {OAlOH}2 ring (Figure 1). The hydrogen-bonded donor–acceptor separations (O⋅⋅⋅O 2.781 and 2.780 Å) are within the range of other similar interactions (O⋅⋅⋅O 2.7 to 3.0 Å).12 The Al center exhibits a distorted tetrahedral geometry with two nitrogen atoms of the L ligand and two OH groups. The most acute N-Al-N angle (96.97(7)°) is the result of forming the β-diketiminato-Al six-membered ring. The C(1) and C(3) atoms of the ligand are both slightly bent out of the N(1)-C(2)-N(2) plane toward the same side (by 5.74 and 5.59°, repsectively), while the Al atom is tilted toward the opposite side of the same plane (23.98°). The crystal structure of 2. The hydrogen atoms of the CH bonds are omitted for clarity. Selected bond lengths [Å] and angles [°]: Al(1)-O(1) 1.7107(16), Al(1)-O(2) 1.6947(15), Al(1)-N(1) 1.8903(16), Al(1)-N(2) 1.8881(17); O(1)-Al(1)-O(2) 115.38(8), O(1)-Al(1)-N(1) 111.61(8), N(1)-Al(1)-N(2) 96.97(7). The AlOH bond lengths (1.6947(15) and 1.7107(16) Å) are significantly shorter than those of the Al(μ-OH) and Al(μ3-OH) bonds in [{(Ph2Si)2O3}4Al4(μ-OH)4] (1.787(3) to 1.814(3) Å, av 1.800 Å),13 [Mes2Al(μ-OH)]2⋅2 THF (1.822 Å; Mes=mesityl),5 and [Al5(tBu)5(μ3-O)2(μ3-OH)2(μ-OH)2(μ-O2CPh)2] (Al(μ3-OH) 1.914(5) to 2.086(4) Å; Al(μ-OH) 1.820(3) to 1.828(3) Å).14 However, The AlOH bond lengths of 2 are comparable to those of the Al(μ-O) bonds in [(HC{(CMe)(NMe)}2AlCl)2(μ-O)] (1.6770(6) Å)15 and [{(tBu)2Al(NH(Me)CH2CH2NMe2)}2(μ-O)] (1.690(7) and 1.714(7) Å),16 in which the linear or almost linear {Al2(μ-O)} cores lead to the significant double-bond character of the AlO bonds. The AlN bond lengths (1.8881(17) and 1.8903(16) Å) are longer than those observed in [(HC{(CMe)(NMe)}2AlCl)2(μ-O)] (1.8611(16) and 1.8617(16) Å),15 and similar to those in [LAl(SeH)2] (1.8996(6) Å).17 Ab initio18 calculations were carried out to investigate the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the electronic structure of 2. The computed interaction energy of the two monomers of 2 (−12.38 kcal mol−1) shows the presence of weak intermolecular hydrogen bonding that is in agreement with the observed O⋅⋅⋅O distances in the X-ray structural analysis. If the protons are placed between donor–acceptor oxygen atoms at two positions (OH=0.96 Å for the free OH group,19 and OH=1.00 Å for the coordinated OH⋅⋅⋅O moiety20), the difference of the energies between these two positions would be very small (less than 1 kcal mol−1) and the protons should vibrate between the O(1) and O(2A) or the O(2) and O(1A) atoms. These results should explain why there are no resonances observed for the coordinated protons in the 1H NMR spectrum of 2. The calculated molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) isosurfaces of the dimer, in comparison with the monomer, are presented in Figure 2. Two negative potential regions (less than −20 kcal mol−1) of the lone pairs of the oxygen atoms are arranged exo to two oxygen atoms in the monomer (Figure 2 a). This would support the reactivity of the oxygen atoms and favor electrophilic attack. The negative regions of MESP on the oxygen atoms in the dimer (Figure 2 b) become larger and overlap for the hydrogen-bond interaction. Furthermore, the π electrons on the aromatic rings, as shown in the MESP map, become stronger and interact with the lone pairs of the oxygen atoms. The argument that the lone-pair electron density of the oxygen atoms is partially transferred to the aromatic rings supports the partial double-bond character of the AlO bonds. A comparable interaction between the aryl oxide lone pairs and the benzophenone AlO σ* orbital was observed in [AlMe(BHT)2] (HBHT=2,6-di-tert-4-methylphenol),21 which results in short AlO bond lengths (1.733(5) and 1.721(6) Å). Calculated molecular potential isosurfaces (−20 kcal mol−1) for a) monomer [LAl(OH)2] (area: 74.82 Å2, volume: 34.25 Å3) and b) dimer [LAl(OH)2]2 (area: 181.77 Å2, volume: 87.93 Å3) at the HF/STO-3G level, show the locations of the lone pairs of the oxygen atoms and the π electrons of the aromatic rings. As a result of proximity to the Lewis acidic AlIII center, the protons of 2 are expected to be Brønsted acidic. The solid-state IR spectrum (Nujol) of 2 exhibits a sharp band (=3727 cm−1) for the free OH groups and a broad band (=3450 cm−1) for the coordinated OH groups which is in agreement with the dimeric structure of 2 in the solid state. It has been demonstrated that the gradient of the electrostatic potential at the proton correlates with the OH stretching frequency.22 However, the stretching mode of the OH group is a qualitative indicator for the acidity of the proton. The absorption of the free OH groups of 2 is higher than those found in the Brønsted acids SAPO-34 (=3600–3625 cm−1)23 and the zeolite Chabazite (=3603 cm−1)24 and, therefore, 2 is a strong Brønsted acid, which is also in agreement with the resonance observed at very low field (δ=12.47 ppm) in the 1H NMR spectrum for the free OH groups. The IR spectra of the filtrate and the THF solution of 2 exhibit broad absorptions at =3434 and 3496 cm−1 which result from hydrogen bridges, while a sharp (=3703 cm−1) and a broad (=3438 cm−1) absorption is observed for the toluene solution of 2. This indicates that the monomeric species exists in both the filtrate and in THF solution, in which the NH3 and THF molecules were coordinated to these OH groups. In contrast, the species in toluene is a hydrogen-bonded dimer of 2. Thus, a new synthetic approach is presented here for the hydrolysis of aluminum compounds, which involves a liquid NH3/toluene two-phase system, to yield hitherto unknown [LAl(OH)2] species. To the best of our knowledge, compound 2 represents an unprecedented congener of the widely explored boronic acid derivative RB(OH)2, and may find new and unusual applications in the near future. Such an investigation is currently in progress in our laboratories. 2: Ammonia (40 mL) was condensed onto a stirred suspension of 1 (2.64 g, 3.8 mmol), KOH (KOH >85 %, H2O 10–15 %; 0.32 g, 4.9 mmol) and KH (0.11 g, 2.8 mmol) in toluene (80 mL) at −78 °C. The mixture was then stirred for 1 h at this temperature, then the excess ammonia was allowed to evaporate from the reaction mixture over a period of 4 h. During this time, the mixture was warmed slowly to room temperature. After filtration and subsequent concentration (to 5 mL) in vacuo, hexane (5 mL) was added to the above filtrate. The resulting colorless solution was kept at −20 °C for one week to isolate colorless crystals of 2 (0.48 g). After isolating the crystals, and the subsequent removal of the solvents from the mother liquor, the hexane (8 mL) was added and the resulting colorless solution was maintained at −20 °C for two days, from which, additional crystals of 2 (0.39 g) were obtained.

"Electron Paramagnetic Resonance, Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersion X-ray Spectrometry, X-ray Powder Diffraction, and NMR Characterization of Iron-Rich Fired Clays","The aim of this study is to clarify the structure of an iron-rich clay and the structural changes involved in the firing process as a preliminary step to get information on ancient ceramic technology. To this purpose, illite-rich clay samples fired at different temperatures were characterized using a multitechnique approach, i.e., by electron paramagnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy with electron dispersion X-ray spectrometry, X-ray powder diffraction, magic angle spinning and multiple quantum magic angle spinning NMR. During firing, four main reaction processes occur: dehydration, dehydroxylation, structural breakdown, and recrystallization. When the results are combined from all characterization methods, the following conclusions could be obtained. Interlayer H2O is located close to aluminum in octahedral sites and is driven off at temperatures lower than 600 degrees C. Between 600 and 700 degrees C dehydroxylation occurs whereas, between 800 and 900 degrees C, the aluminum in octahedral sites disappears, due to the breakdown of the illite structure, and all iron present is oxidized to Fe3+. In samples fired at 1000 and 1100 degrees C iron clustering was observed as well as large single crystals of iron with the occurrence of ferro- or ferrimagnetic effects. Below 900 degrees C the aluminum in octahedral sites presents a continuous distribution of chemical shift, suggesting the presence of slightly distorted sites. Finally, over the whole temperature range, the presence of at least two tetrahedral aluminum sites was revealed, characterized by different values of the quadrupolar coupling constant.",https://openalex.org/W2054506656,2005,Federica Presciutti; Donatella Capitani; Antonio Sgamellotti,University of Perugia

"Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Properties of Pillared Montmorillonite with Aluminum/Cerium Polyoxycations","This paper describes the preparation of pillared montmorillonite by means of mixed aluminum and cerium oligomers. When cerium was incorporated into the materials, the basal spacing increased up to 26 Å. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicated total absence of tetrahedral aluminum in the polyoxycations incorporated between the clay sheets. These results indicate that AlCe-pillared montmorillonite incorporates inorganic polyoxycations with a chemical nature different from that of the aluminum polyoxycation or Keggin ion [AlO4Al12(OH)24(H2O)12]7+. The texture of the materials showed a high specific surface area and porosity, with generation of pores at the limit between the microporous and mesoporous zones. The number and strength of the acid sites in these materials were also high. The catalytic behavior of the materials in the hydrocracking and hydroisomerization reaction of n-heptane was compared with that of materials obtained from the same montmorillonite and intercalation of the Keggin ion. The AlCe-pillared samples showed increased conversion and improved the selectivity toward the products of cracking.",https://openalex.org/W2075708888,2001,M. J. Hernando; C. Pesquera; C.

Activation Conditions Play a Key Role in the Activity of Zeolite CaY:  NMR and Product Studies of Brønsted Acidity,"CaY, activated under different conditions, was characterized with 1H, 31P, and 1H/27Al double resonance MAS NMR. The 1H MAS NMR spectra of CaY, calcined in an oven at 500 °C, shows resonances from H2O (bound to Ca2+ and the zeolite framework), CaOH+, aluminum hydroxides, silanols, and Brønsted acid sites. No evidence for Lewis acidity is observed on adsorption of trimethylphosphine, and an estimate of ≈16 Brønsted acid sites per unit cell is obtained for this sample. CaY activated in an oven at higher temperatures contains less water, but all the other species are still present. In contrast, CaY activated by slow ramping of the temperature under vacuum to 500 or 600 °C shows a much lower concentration of Brønsted acid sites (<1/unit cell). Again, no evidence for Lewis acidity was observed. These NMR results have been utilized to understand the very different product distributions that are observed for reactions of 1,1- and 1,2-diarylethylenes in zeolite CaY activated in an oven (in air) and under vacuum. Samples with high concentrations of Brønsted acid sites react stoichiometrically with these sites, yielding diarylalkanes. At low concentrations, the Brønsted acid sites can act catalytically resulting in isomerization reactions.",https://openalex.org/W2055946175,1998,Hsien‐Ming Kao; Clare P.

"Description of input and examples for PHREEQC version 3: A computer program for speciation, batch-reaction, one-dimensional transport, and inverse geochemical calculations","PHREEQC version 3 is a computer program written in the C and C++ programming languages that is designed to perform a wide variety of aqueous geochemical calculations. PHREEQC implements several types of aqueous models: two ion-association aqueous models (the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory model and WATEQ4F), a Pitzer specific-ion-interaction aqueous model, and the SIT (Specific ion Interaction Theory) aqueous model. Using any of these aqueous models, PHREEQC has capabilities for (1) speciation and saturation-index calculations; (2) batch-reaction and one-dimensional (1D) transport calculations with reversible and irreversible reactions, which include aqueous, mineral, gas, solid-solution, surface-complexation, and ion-exchange equilibria, and specified mole transfers of reactants, kinetically controlled reactions, mixing of solutions, and pressure and temperature changes; and (3) inverse modeling, which finds sets of mineral and gas mole transfers that account for differences in composition between waters within specified compositional uncertainty limits. Many new modeling features were added to PHREEQC version 3 relative to version 2. The Pitzer aqueous model (pitzer.dat database, with keyword PITZER) can be used for high-salinity waters that are beyond the range of application for the Debye-Hückel theory. The Peng-Robinson equation of state has been implemented for calculating the solubility of gases at high pressure. Specific volumes of aqueous species are calculated as a function of the dielectric properties of water and the ionic strength of the solution, which allows calculation of pressure effects on chemical reactions and the density of a solution. The specific conductance and the density of a solution are calculated and printed in the output file. In addition to Runge-Kutta integration, a stiff ordinary differential equation solver (CVODE) has been included for kinetic calculations with multiple rates that occur at widely different time scales. Surface complexation can be calculated with the CD-MUSIC (Charge Distribution MUltiSIte Complexation) triple-layer model in addition to the diffuse-layer model. The composition of the electrical double layer of a surface can be estimated by using the Donnan approach, which is more robust and faster than the alternative Borkovec-Westall integration. Multicomponent diffusion, diffusion in the electrostatic double layer on a surface, and transport of colloids with simultaneous surface complexation have been added to the transport module. A series of keyword data blocks has been added for isotope calculations—ISOTOPES, CALCULATE_VALUES, ISOTOPE_ALPHAS, ISOTOPE_RATIOS, and NAMED_EXPRESSIONS. Solution isotopic data can be input in conventional units (for example, permil, percent modern carbon, or tritium units) and the numbers are converted to moles of isotope by PHREEQC. The isotopes are treated as individual components (they must be defined as individual master species) so that each isotope has its own set of aqueous species, gases, and solids. The isotope-related keywords allow calculating equilibrium fractionation of isotopes among the species and phases of a system. The calculated isotopic compositions are printed in easily readable conventional units. New keywords and options facilitate the setup of input files and the interpretation of the results. Keyword data blocks can be copied (keyword COPY) and deleted (keyword DELETE). Keyword data items can be altered by using the keyword data blocks with the _MODIFY extension and a simulation can be run with all reactants of a given index number (keyword RUN_CELLS). The definition of the complete chemical state of all reactants of PHREEQC can be saved in a file in a raw data format ( DUMP and _RAW keywords). The file can be read as part of another input file with the INCLUDE$ keyword. These keywords facilitate the use of IPhreeqc, which is a module implementing all PHREEQC version 3 capabilities; the module is designed to be used in other programs that need to implement geochemical calculations; for example, transport codes. Charting capabilities have been added to some versions of PHREEQC. Charting capabilities have been added to Windows distributions of PHREEQC version 3. (Charting on Linux requires installation of Wine.) The keyword data block USER_GRAPH allows selection of data for plotting and manipulation of chart appearance. Almost any results from geochemical simulations (for example, concentrations, activities, or saturation indices) can be retrieved by using Basic language functions and specified as data for plotting in USER_GRAPH. Results of transport simulations can be plotted against distance or time. Data can be added to a chart from tab-separated-values files. All input for PHREEQC version 3 is defined in keyword data blocks, each of which may have a series of identifiers for specific types of data. This report provides a complete description of each keyword data block and its associated identifiers. Input files for 22 examples that demonstrate most of the capabilities of PHREEQC version 3 are described and the results of the example simulations are presented and discussed.",https://openalex.org/W1251722559,2013,David L.

Self-limiting deposition of aluminum oxide thin films by pulsed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition,"Self-limiting deposition of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) thin films was accomplished by pulsed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using a continuous delivery of trimethyl aluminum (TMA) and O2. Film characterization included spectroscopic ellipsometry and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Deposition rates scaled with TMA exposure and could be controlled over a large range of 1–20Å∕pulse. For fixed conditions, digital control over film thickness is demonstrated. Deposition rates initially decreased with substrate temperature before becoming constant for Ts&amp;gt;100°C. Higher growth rates at low temperature are attributed to the thermal reaction between H2O, produced during the plasma on step, with TMA during the plasma off step. Gas-phase analysis confirms the coexistence of these species, and their degree of overlap is a strong function of the chamber wall temperature. With both the substrate and chamber wall temperature elevated, impurities related to carbon and hydroxyl groups are attenuated below the detection limit of FTIR.",https://openalex.org/W2014953135,2008,Scott F.

Assessment of Chlorine−Alkali−Mineral Interactions during Co-Combustion of Coal and Straw,"During co-combustion of coal and straw, ash deposition and pollutants (HCl, aerosols, etc.) formation is significantly influenced by the behavior of chlorine and alkali metals. On the bases of measurement data, the effect of inherent minerals in blended fuels on the release and retention of chlorine and alkali metals is investigated through the equilibrium analysis tool FACT-Win. Si, Al, Ca, Mg, and S may greatly affect the behavior of Cl, K, and Na, where the other minor elements, such as Fe, Ti, and Mn have not much influence. According to measurement data, very low amounts of chlorine and sulfur are retained in bottom, air preheater, and cyclone ash in a pulverized fuel combustor. But in filter ash, the chlorine and sulfur contents are relatively high and the ratio (K + Na)/(Cl + 2S) is close to 1. According to equilibrium calculations, in hard coal co-combustion with less than 50% straw, most of the potassium is combined with aluminosilicates to form KAlSi2O6(s,s2), etc., which can prevent ash depositing on the furnace surface. Besides the formation of NaAlSi3O8(s2), some sodium is released as NaCl(g) and NaOH(g). In brown coal co-combustion, most of the potassium is released as KCl(g), KOH(g), and K2SO4(g) because aluminum can be combined in the Ca and Mg compounds, such as Ca3Al2O6(s), CaAl2O4(s), and MgAl2O4(s). Increasing the straw fraction reduces KAlSi2O6(s2) and increases K2Si4O9(liq). Most of the sodium is released as NaOH(g), NaCl(g) and Na2SO4(g). Na2SO4(liq) is formed between 1200 and 1400 K for conditions with less than 50% straw. In pure straw combustion, KCl(g) and K2Si4O9(liq) are the main species. During the gas cooling, KCl(g) and KOH(g) may react with SO2(g) and H2O(g) to form K2SO4(g) and then a lot of aerosols are formed. Finally, the possible reactions involving chlorine and alkali metals are analyzed.",https://openalex.org/W2008942774,2002,Xiaolin Wei; C. Lopez; Thore von Puttkamer,University of Stuttgart
Atomic Layer Deposition of Aluminum Oxide on TiO<sub>2</sub> and Its Impact on N3 Dye Adsorption from First Principles,"The atomic layer deposition of aluminum oxide on an OH-terminated TiO2(101) anatase surface was studied employing density functional theory calculations. The formation of the Al2O3−TiO2 interface during the first atomic layer deposition cycle was modeled by studying the dissociative adsorption of an Al(CH3)3 precursor, followed with a H2O-pulse reaction step that changes the surface termination. Calculations provide evidence for the formation of a discontinuous, atomically rough aluminum oxide layer after the first cycle. To explore the role of the aluminum oxide layer on adsorption of a ruthenium-based N3 dye molecule, various adsorption geometries were investigated. Calculations show that even one Al2O3 ALD cycle is enough to block N3 adsorption on the TiO2. Consequently, N3 anchors to the aluminum oxide layer, which increases the dye−TiO2 distance by ∼2 Å, changes the adsorption site, and weakens the coupling to TiO2. All these factors suppress forward electron injection from the dye molecule to the TiO2 conduction band edge. It is, therefore, questionable whether the aluminum oxide layer can offer improvements to the conversion efficiency in dye-sensitized solar cells.",https://openalex.org/W2329121366,2011,Ville Mäkinen; Karoliina Honkala; Hannu Häkkinen,University of Jyväskylä
Observation and Reactivity of the Chainlike Species ([Al(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>3-</sup>)<i><sub>n</sub></i> during the X-ray Diffraction Investigation of the Hydrothermal Synthesis of the Super-sodalite Sodium Aluminophosphate MIL-74 (Na<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>7</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>12</sub>·4<i>t</i><i>renH</i><i><sub>3</sub></i>·Na(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>16</sub>),"The hydrothermal synthesis of the aluminum phosphate Na2Al7(PO4)12·4trenH3·Na(H2O)16 (MIL-74) has been studied by X-ray diffraction (conventional source) and in-situ time-resolved energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction (synchrotron radiation). Before the crystallization of MIL-74, the reaction of the starting aqueous aluminophosphate gel containing the tren species (tris(2-aminoethyl)amine) and sodium hydroxide gives rise to the formation of a hydrated chainlike solid Al(PO4)2·trenH3·6H2O (phase 1), which transforms into the hydrate Al(PO4)2·trenH3·2.5H2O (phase 2) upon heating at 180 °C. Its structure was determined by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and consists of a one-dimensional inorganic chain of tetrahedral unit AlO4 alternating with the phosphate group PO4. The resulting ([Al(PO4)2]3-)n chains interact through hydrogen bonds with the trenH3 and water molecules, generating a layerlike inorganic−organic network. Phase 2 was observed to be an intermediate, which disappears when the MIL-74 solid starts to crystallize. The observation of such an intermediate phase allows for the proposition of a chemical reaction pathway for the formation of the three-dimensional network of MIL-74. It seems that the sodium cations play a crucial role and directly react with the chainlike precursor. They would participate in the construction of the inorganic framework as anchorage nodes during the condensation process.",https://openalex.org/W1998226261,2004,Thierry Loiseau; L.

Effect of Vacuum Degassing on Surface Characteristics of Rapidly Solidified Al-Based Alloy Powders,"During the rapidly solidified powder metallurgy processing of aluminum alloys, the vacuum degassing process should be carried out before powder consolidation in order to remove the adsorbed moisture and gaseous species that are harmful to consolidation from the powder-oxide skin. Therefore it is important to clarify the effect of vacuum degassing on surface characteristics of the gas-atomized aluminum alloy powders. Temperature-programmed desorption measurement on the Al-Ti-Fe-Cr and Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Ag powders exposed to humid air, dry air and high purity argon gas was performed to determine the gas species evolved during degassing. It was found that the surface composition and processing atmosphere had a strong influence on the gas desorption behavior and on the surface characteristics of the powders. Adsorbed H2O on the surface of the powders brought about the formation of fresh Al2O3 layer by the reaction, 2Al + 3H2O = Al2O3 + 3H2, although adsorbed oxygen caused no formation of fresh Al2O3 during degassing. The surface oxide of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Ag powder was more prone to hydration than that of Al-Ti-Fe-Cr powder. Accordingly, the formation of fresh Al2O3 on the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Ag powder at low temperature of 390 K occurred during vacuum degassing with much H2O adsorbed. On the other hand, Al-Ti-Fe-Cr alloy powders had less adsorbed H2O, resulting in the formation of fresh Al2O3 above 450 K during vacuum degassing.",https://openalex.org/W2147372497,2004,Michiaki Yamasaki; Yoshihito Kawamura,Kumamoto University
Transmetalation of Aqueous Inorganic Clusters: A Useful Route to the Synthesis of Heterometallic Aluminum and Indium Hydroxo—Aquo Clusters,"[AlxIny(μ3-OH)6(μ-OH)18(H2O)24](NO3)15 hydroxy-aquo clusters (AlxIn13-x) are synthesized through the evaporation of stoichiometrically varied solutions of Al13 and In(NO3)3 using a transmetalation reaction. Several spectroscopic techniques ((1)H NMR, (1)H-diffusion ordered spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and Raman) are used to compare AlxIn13-x to its Al13 counterpart. A thin film of aluminum indium oxide was prepared from an Al7In6 cluster ink, showing its utility as a precursor for materials.",https://openalex.org/W2103365110,2014,Maisha K.

Density Functional Investigation of the Water Exchange Reaction on the Gibbsite Surface,"The water exchange reactions on the gibbsite surface have been investigated by density functional calculations (B3LYP/6-31G(d) level) combining the supermolecular model and PCM model in this paper, and the water exchange rate constants on the gibbsite surface have also been predicted. In the proposed reaction pathways, the clusters Al6(OH)18(H2O)6(0) and Al6(OH)12(H2O)12(6+) are used as the models of gibbsite surface and protonated gibbsite surface respectively to examine the effect of protonation of gibbsite surface on the water exchange rate constants. The activation energy barriers DeltaE(s) not equal to (aq) for Al6(OH)18(H2O)6(0) and Al6(OH)12(H2O)12(6+) are 28.6 and 27.2 kJ*mol-1, respectively. The reaction energies DeltaE(s) (aq) for Al6(OH)18(H2O)6(0) and Al6(OH)12(H2O)12(6+) are 2.9 and 14.4 kJ mol-1, respectively, indicating that hexacoordinate aluminum in the gibbsite surface is more stable. The log k(TST) for Al6(OH)18(H2O)6(0) and Al6(OH)12(H2O)12(6+) are 6.5 and 7.5 respectively, and the log k(ex) calculated by the given transmission coefficient for Al6(OH)18-(H2O)6(0) and Al6(OH)12(H2O)12(6+) are 2.4 and 3.4 respectively, indicating that the protonation of gibbsite surface promotes the water exchange reaction of gibbsite surface and accelerates the dissolution rate of gibbsite. The relationship between the calculated free energy and experimental rate constants was explored, and according to this relationship, the log k(ex) for Al6(OH)18(H2O)6(0) and Al6(OH)12(H2O)12(6+) are 2.5 and 3.1 respectively, close to the corresponding values calculated by the given transmission coefficient. The water exchange rate constant of gibbsite surface is close to those of K-MAl(12)(M = Al, Ga, and Ge) polyoxocations, but deviates from that of Al(H2O)6(3+), implying that the same reactions with similar structure have similar water exchange rate constants.",https://openalex.org/W2057056527,2009,Zhaosheng Qian; Hui Feng; Xiaoyan Jin,Nanjing University; Zhejiang Normal University
Preparation and Properties of Fluorinated Alumina-Pillared α-Zirconium Phosphate Materials,"A polyoxyaluminum cluster, larger than the tridecamer ion [AlO4Al12(OH)24(H2O)12]7+, was intercalated into α-zirconium phosphate using an oligomeric solution aged at 368 K and conducting the intercalation reaction, first at reflux and then with hydrothermal treatment, in the presence of F-. Different intercalation compounds were prepared by varying the Al3+/phosphate ratio, but a unique single phase material with basal spacing of 21.3 Å was obtained. As revealed by chemical analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), F- is incorporated into the intercalated oligomer where it partially substitutes OH- ions. The XPS technique was also a helpful tool to determine the Al3+ concentration from which other Al3+ compounds are precipitated outside of the phosphate interlayer. Thermal treatment caused a continuous and gradual interlayer contraction up to 973 K, but no evidence of layer collapse or segregation of alumina was found, at least up to 1273 K. 31P and 27Al solid state NMR spectroscopies were used to investigate the mechanism of interaction between the phosphate layer and the aluminum species. Because of this interaction, the 31P signal shifts toward higher field, at ≈20 ppm, while the 27Al NMR spectra display the characteristic signal of octahedrally coordinated Al and of a new resonance between 44.8 and 49.8 ppm, which is related to the existence of Al−O−P bonds. An increase of the relative intensity of this signal was observed upon calcination of the materials at 673 K. The presence of F- in the interlayer aluminum oxide produced an enhancement of the thermal stability and porosity of the pillared materials. Studies of thermal-programmed desorption of NH3, pyridine adsorption, and decomposition of isopropyl alcohol have revealed the acid nature of fluorinated alumina-pillared α-ZrP materials. The acid sites catalyze the dehydration reaction of isopropyl alcohol with a selectivity of practically 100%.",https://openalex.org/W2153295313,1996,J.

Steric Stabilization of a Monomeric Proalumatrane:  Experimental and Theoretical Studies,"Treatment of tripodal tris(3-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzyl)amine (L) with 1 equiv of trimethylaluminum in toluene gave the stable proalumatrane (AlL) (1) [wherein L = tris(3-tert-butyl-5-methyl-2-oxidobenzyl)amine] featuring a distorted trigonal monopyramidal four-coordinate aluminum geometry. An analogous reaction uses the less sterically congested isomer of L, namely, tris(5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-methylbenzyl)amine provided dimeric (AlL')2 (2) [wherein L' = tris(5-tert-butyl-3-methyl-2-oxidobenzyl)amine], which contains two bridging alumatrane moieties possessing five-coordinate TBP aluminum geometries. Reaction of AlL with water provided the adduct H2O. AlL (3), a species that is representative of a coordinatively stabilized intermediate in the hydrolysis of an aluminum alkoxide. Theoretical calculations revealed that considerable stabilization energy is obtained by the coordination of a water molecule to the tetracoordinate aluminum in AlL and that this result is consistent with the postulate that the Lewis acidity of AlL exceeds that of boron trifluoride, despite the presence of the transannular N-->Al bond in AlL.",https://openalex.org/W1968360345,2007,Weiping Su; Junji Kobayashi; Arkady Ellern,The University of Tokyo; Iowa State University
Reaction Mechanisms of the Initial Oligomerization of Aluminophosphate,"The mechanisms of aluminophosphate oligomerization were investigated using density functional theory with the SMD solvation model. Two aluminum species, Al(OH)4(-) and Al(H2O)6(3+), and four phosphorus species, H3PO4, H2PO4(-), HPO4(2-), and PO4(3-), were considered as the monomers for polycondensation reactions. It was found that the most favorable pathway to dimerization was a Lewis acid-base reaction: the aprotic oxygen of phosphoric acid (P═O) performs a nucleophilic attack on the central aluminum atom of Al(OH)4(-). Using this mechanism as a pattern, plausible dimerization mechanisms were investigated by varying the proticity and hydration of the phosphorus and aluminum monomers, respectively. The relative reaction rates of each mechanism were estimated under different pH conditions. The chain growth of aluminophosphates to trimers, tetramers, and pentamers and the cyclization of a linear tetramer were also investigated. For oligomerization reactions beyond dimer formation, it is found that cluster growth favors the addition of the phosphoric monomers rather than aluminum monomers.",https://openalex.org/W2341083278,2016,Xiang Yan; Xin Liang; Joshua D.

Theoretical Study on Reaction Mechanism of Aluminum-Water System,"A theoretical study on the reaction of aluminum with water in the gas phase was performed using the hybrid density functional B3LYP and QCISD(T) methods with the 6-311+G(d,p) and the 6-311++G(d,p) basis sets. The results show that there are three possible reaction pathways that involve four isomers, seven transition structures, and two possible products for the reaction of aluminum with water. The two most favorable reaction pathways were found, whose intermediates and products agreed quite well with experimental results. The enthalpy and Gibbs free energy change of the reaction between Al and H2O at 298 and 2000 K were calculated. Some results are also in good agreement with the previous calculations or experimental results.",https://openalex.org/W1982576508,2008,Yunlan Sun; Yan Tian; Shufen Li,Anhui University of Technology; University of Science and Technology of China
Dependence of Nano-Aluminum and Water Propellant Combustion on pH and Rheology,"Over the past few years, the combustion of nano-aluminum/water (nAl/H2O) propellants has been widely reported, but further progress has been slowed for the following reason: the loosely correlated trends in combustion data are insufficient in guiding further research efforts, and they cannot be used to significantly improve the Isp observed in static rocket motor tests. It was previously found that different mixing techniques (hand, planetary and resonant mixers, duration and temperature), or equivalence ratio gave rise to different burning rates, but the influence of pH and rheology on nAl/H2O propellants was not considered. We find that the effects of pH on nAl/H2O propellants are profound, and correlate well with viscosity, low pressure deflagration limits, burning rate exponents, and rocket motor performance. Our findings suggest that coagulation can influence the pressure exponent over a wide range of values (0.34–0.68). For particle diameters <1 µm, dispersion during mixing is affected more by electrostatic repulsion from charged ions than from mechanical agitation, and this is reflected through zeta potential and viscosity measurements at different pH levels. Additionally, we observe that pH has an influence on nAl/H2O reaction kinetics during ignition, as the propellant transitions from low temperature oxidation to high temperature combustion.",https://openalex.org/W2053554610,2013,David E.
