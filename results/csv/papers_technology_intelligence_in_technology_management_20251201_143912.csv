"Artificial intelligence, robotics, advanced technologies and human resource management: a systematic review","Although academic production in intelligent automation (e.g. artificial intelligence, robotics) has grown rapidly, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the utilization of these technologies in human resource management (HRM) at an organizational (firms) and individual (employees) level. This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research.",https://openalex.org/W3130894836,2021,Demetris Vrontis; Michael Christofi; Vijay Pereira,University of Nicosia; NEOMA Business School
Development and evaluation of a low-cost and smart technology for precision weed management utilizing artificial intelligence,"Most conventional sprayers apply agrochemicals uniformly, despite the fact that distribution of weeds is typically patchy, resulting in wastage of valuable compounds, increased costs, crop damage risk, pest resistance to chemicals, environmental pollution and contamination of products. To reduce these negative impacts, a smart sprayer was designed and developed utilizing machine vision and artificial intelligence to distinguish target weeds from non-target objects (e.g. vegetable crops) and precisely spray on the desired target/location. Two different experimental scenarios were designed to simulate a vegetable field and to evaluate the smart sprayer’s performance. The first scenario contained artificial weeds (targets) and artificial plants (non-targets). The second and most challenging scenario contained real plants; portulaca weeds as targets, and sedge weeds and pepper plants as non-targets. Two different embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) were evaluated as the smart sprayer processing unit (for image processing and target detection). The more powerful GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti) achieved an overall precision of 71% and recall of 78% (for plant detection and target spraying accuracy) on the most challenging scenario with real plants, and 91% accuracy and recall for the first scenario with artificial plants. The less powerful GPU (NVIDIA Jetson TX2) achieved an overall precision and recall of 90% and 89% respectively on the first scenario with artificial plants, and 59% and 44% respectively on the second scenario with real plants. Finally, an RTK GPS was connected to the smart sprayer and an algorithm was developed to automatically generate weed maps and visualize the collected data (after every application). This smart technology integrates a state of the art (AI-based) weed detection system, a novel fast and precision spraying system, and a weed mapping system. It can significantly reduce the quantity of agrochemicals required, especially compared with traditional broadcast sprayers that usually treat the entire field, resulting in unnecessary application to areas that do not require treatment. It could also reduce costs, risk of crop damage and excess herbicide residue, as well as potentially reduce environmental impact.",https://openalex.org/W2908783980,2019,Victor Partel; Sri Charan Kakarla; Yiannis Ampatzidis,Southwest Florida Research; University of Florida
How will artificial intelligence and Industry 4.0 emerging technologies transform operations management?,"Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, additive manufacturing, advanced robotics, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things are frequently mentioned as part of “Industry 4.0.” As such, how will they influence operations and supply chain management? We answer this question by providing a brief review of the evolution of technologies and operations management (OM) over time. Because terms such as “Industry 4.0” do not have a precise definition, we focus on more fundamental issues raised by Industry 4.0 emerging technologies for research in OM. We propose a theory of disruptive debottlenecking and the SACE framework by classifying emerging technologies in terms of the functionalities they enable: sense, analyze, collaborate, and execute. Subsequently, we review the nascent but rapidly growing literature at the interface between digital technologies and OM. Our review suggests that one way to assess the value of Industry 4.0 technologies can be via their influence on adding revenues, differentiating, reducing costs, optimizing risks, innovating, and transforming business models and processes. Finally, we conclude by proposing an agenda for further research.",https://openalex.org/W4295007572,2022,Sunil Mithas; Zhi‐Long Chen; Terence Saldanha,"University of South Florida; University of Maryland, College Park; University of Georgia"

Artificial intelligence technologies for personnel learning management systems,An essential part of modern education is computing. Learning management systems are introduced as an intermediary between a student and a teacher. This paradigm is shifted through reproduction of teacher's and student's intelligent procedures by intelligent agents. The Artificial Intelligence technologies are based on reproduction of principles of human intelligence. Functioning of general Artificial Intelligence is based on principle of double contingency and is impossible without the acquisition of elements of self-consciousness and self-cultivation that can be embodied in Artificial Neural Network. On its basis it is proposed to make intelligent agents on platform IBM Bluemix with IBM Watson technology. These agents in the form of chatbots have to automate the interaction between the student and the teacher within the frames of Moodle learning management system.,https://openalex.org/W2552036552,2016,Nayden Nenkov; George Dimitrov; Yuriy Dyachenko,Shumen University; University of Library Studies and Information Technologies; Volodymyr Dahl East Ukrainian National University
Enterprise Human Resource Management Model By Artificial Intelligence Digital Technology,"As a result of the implementation of artificial intelligence, there is a possibility that the existing organizational structures and management procedures will go through significant transformations (AI). Conventional organizational structures as well as the decision-making processes of companies are being completely upended by AI. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) that is based on AI digitizing technology is used in the construction of a salary prediction model (SPM), which is then subjected to the Nesterov and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Nadam) approach for the purpose of further enhancing its accuracy. The end output is known by its full title, which is a salary prediction model (SPM). The results of this study have the potential to have a positive impact on the HRM process, the amount of work that human resource managers have to do, and the overall efficiency of professions. According to the findings, the Nadam optimization technique offered the highest degree of optimization performance as well as the fastest convergence. The duration of the training was exactly 186 seconds, and the final score for the expected outcome was 0.75 percent. Further proof of the SPM's validity may be seen in the remarkable learning performance as well as the accuracy rate of up to 79.4% achieved by Nadam's BPNN-based SPM optimization.

Internet of Things for Green Building Management: Disruptive Innovations Through Low-Cost Sensor Technology and Artificial Intelligence,"Buildings consume 60% of global electricity. However, current building management systems (BMSs) are highly expensive and difficult to justify for small- to medium-sized buildings. The Internet of Things (IoT), which can collect and monitor a large amount of data on different aspects of a building and feed the data to the BMS's processor, provides a new opportunity to integrate intelligence into the BMS for monitoring and managing a building's energy consumption to reduce costs. Although an extensive literature is available on, separately, IoTbased BMSs and applications of signal processing techniques for some building energy-management tasks, a detailed study of their integration to address the overall BMS is limited. As such, this article will address the current gap by providing an overview of an IoT-based BMS that leverages signal processing and machine-learning techniques. We demonstrate how to extract high-level building occupancy information through simple, low-cost IoT sensors and study how human activities impact a building's energy use-information that can be exploited to design energy conservation measures that reduce the building's energy consumption.",https://openalex.org/W2889836481,2018,Wayes Tushar; Nipun Wijerathne; Wen-Tai Li,Queensland University of Technology; The University of Queensland; Care International Sri Lanka

"Demystifying the roles of organisational smart technology, artificial intelligence, robotics and algorithms capability: A strategy for green human resource management and environmental sustainability","Abstract With growing climate change concerns, and constant advancements in smart technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, and algorithms (STARA), organisations in emerging economies are becoming more compelled to go green, develop and deploy their STARA capability to boost profits more effectively, and their environmental sustainability (ES). Likewise, with governments increasingly calling for ES, organisations' human resource management (HRM) is further pressured to ensure their programmes aid realisation of environmental objectives without compromising profit maximisation. However, it remains unclear how complementary Green HRM (GHRM) programmes can be supported by organisational STARA capability (OSC) to bolster ES. Accordingly, we investigate how OSC and GHRM programmes predict ES through a time lagged survey design with data from 461 managers of 177 manufacturing organisations in Nigeria. Results indicate that OSC positively predicts all GHRM programmes and ES but dampens the positive relationship between green training, involvement and development (GTID), and ES. Apart from green performance and compensation (GPC), which is a negative predictor, other GHRM programmes positively predict ES. While green recruitment and selection (GRS) and GTID are complementary mediators, GPC plays a competitive mediating role. Policy implications are subsequently discussed.",https://openalex.org/W4382195859,2023,Samuel Ogbeibu; Jude Emelifeonwu; Vijay Pereira,University of Bradford; NEOMA Business School
"Medication management needs information and communications technology‐based approaches, including telehealth and artificial intelligence","Life expectancy is rising in most parts of the world as is the prevalence of chronic diseases. Suboptimal adherence to long‐term medications is still rather the norm than the exception, although it is well known that suboptimal adherence compromises the therapeutic effectiveness. Information and communications technology provides new concepts for improving adherence to medications. These so‐called telehealth concepts or services help to implement closed‐loop healthcare paradigms and to establish collaborative care networks involving all stakeholders relevant to optimising the overall medication therapy. Together with data from Electronic Health Records and Electronic Medical Records, these networks pave the way to data‐driven decision support systems. Recent advances in machine learning, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence allow further steps towards fully autonomous telehealth systems. This might bring advances in the future: disburden healthcare professionals from repetitive tasks, enable them to timely react to critical situations, and offer a comprehensive overview of the patients' medication status. Advanced analytics can help to assess whether patients have taken their medications as prescribed, to improve adherence via automatic reminders. Ultimately, all relevant data sources need to be collated into a basis for data‐driven methods, with the goal to assist healthcare professionals in guiding patients to obtain the best possible health status, with a reasonable resource utilisation and a risk‐adjusted safety and privacy approach. This paper summarises the state‐of‐the‐art of telehealth and artificial intelligence applications in medication management. It focuses on 3 major aspects: latest technologies, current applications, and patient related issues.",https://openalex.org/W2953834619,2019,Alphons Eggerth; Dieter Hayn; G.

The Influence of Artificial Intelligence Technology on the Management of Livestock Farms,"This review was conducted to demonstrate how artificial intelligence (AI) has affected livestock farming. Livestock is essential for maintaining ecological integrity and providing food security. In this review, the history of artificial intelligence (AI), its impact on current and future livestock farming, and its drawbacks have been highlighted. The term “artificial intelligence,” was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956, and currently, the technology is widely applied in the management of many livestock farms like poultry, dairy, and pigs. Although it has been studied for decades and widely applied, AI is still one of the least understood subfields. Artificial intelligence provides farmers with unrivalled support, enabling them to minimize resource use, improve the sustainability of their feeding patterns, and increase farm productivity in general, especially when it comes to reducing the carbon footprint. AI is a blessing for boosting efficiency and productivity while also lowering the possibility of human error. Producers can use artificial intelligence to simulate human decision-making and provide interpretations and solutions for the data gathered by sensors and other hardware technologies. Through AI tools, it is possible to easily trace animal activities and locations and collect data about behaviors, habitats, and health conditions. Animal identification, animal welfare monitoring, sex determination, vaccine delivery, and pasture evaluation are some areas where AI has been widely applied so far. Drones, robots, and blockchains are some forms of automation that have been widely used in dairy farms. However, the expense of development, which needs more infrastructure on the farm, and the potential for automation to replace them are the limitations of the technology.",https://openalex.org/W4390659812,2024,Awoke Melak; Tesfalem Aseged; Takele Shitaw,Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute

Findings – The successful implementation of an internal BI system should include the core components and address operational issues, whilst also providing meaningful output to the organisation. It is contended, however, that to be truly successful, the internal BI system must be embedded within organisational processes and be adaptable to changing technologies, allowing the exploitation of the organisation’s internal BI. Originality/value – This general review is the first to provide a high-level overview of internal BI and explores the role of technology in the management and exploitation of internal BI.",https://openalex.org/W1890945203,2015,Ronda Harrison; Angelique Parker; Gabrielle Brosas,Swinburne University of Technology
An extension of the technology acceptance model for business intelligence systems: project management maturity perspective,"Business intelligence systems (BISs) refer to a wide range of technologies and applications useful for retrieving and analyzing a large amount of information with the goal to generate knowledge useful for making effective business decision. In order to investigate adoption of BISs in companies, we propose a model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) that is expanded by variables representing the concept of a project management maturity (PMM). The survey on the sample of USA companies has been conducted with the chief information officer (CIO) as the main informant. A structural equation model has been developed in order to test the research model. Results indicate that TAM expanded with the notion of PMM is useful in increasing understanding of BISs adoption in companies.",https://openalex.org/W2755051337,2022,Mirjana Pejić Bach; Jovana Zoroja; Amer Čeljo,University of Zagreb; Sarajevo School of Science and Technology; University of Sarajevo
Smart management of combined sewer overflows: From an ancient technology to artificial intelligence,"Abstract Sewer systems are an essential part of sanitation infrastructure for protecting human and ecosystem health. Initially, they were used to solely convey stormwater, but over time municipal sewage was discharged to these conduits and transformed them into combined sewer systems (CSS). Due to climate change and rapid urbanization, these systems are no longer sufficient and overflow in wet weather conditions. Mechanistic and data‐driven models have been frequently used in research on combined sewer overflow (CSO) management integrating low‐impact development and gray‐green infrastructures. Recent advances in measurement, communication, and computation technologies have simplified data collection methods. As a result, technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), geographic information system, and remote sensing can be integrated into CSO and stormwater management as a part of the smart city and digital twin concepts to build climate‐resilient infrastructures and services. Therefore, smart management of CSS is now both technically and economically feasible to tackle the challenges ahead. This review article explores CSO characteristics and associated impact on receiving waterbodies, evaluates suitable models for CSO management, and presents studies including above‐mentioned technologies in the context of smart CSO and stormwater management. Although integration of all these technologies has a big potential, further research is required to achieve AI‐controlled CSS for robust and agile CSO mitigation.

Safety Management of Civil Engineering Construction Based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Vision Technology,"With the development of social economy and the progress of science and technology, the process of urbanization continues to deepen and the progress of the construction industry changes with each passing day. People are paying more and more attention to the safety of civil engineering. Accidents frequently occurred during the construction process, which exposed the lack of attention to safety issues during the construction process, the lack of effective supervision of safe construction, and the lack of safety awareness of construction personnel, which had an impact on the construction of civil engineering. In this article, a solution to the safety management system for construction personnel based on artificial intelligence machine vision technology is proposed for the study of the safety management of civil engineering structures. First of all, through the research and analysis of the problems in the safety management of construction workers, the types of safety accidents of construction workers are summarized and the effect of machine understanding of the construction scene is realized through target detection and description of the spatial interaction between the two. A real‐time detection and early warning platform is built, and early warnings are automatically sent out when a predefined dangerous scene occurs, so as to achieve the purpose of preventing construction accidents. The experimental results in this paper show that, in the use of artificial intelligence machine vision technology to manage the safety of civil engineering construction, the safety management of workers in the construction is realized, and the results show that the level of construction safety management has increased to 97.4%, ensuring the quality of civil engineering construction and safety.",https://openalex.org/W4200320621,2021,Yuting Zhang,Liaoning Technical University

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Diagnosis and Management of Stroke: A Narrative Review of United States Food and Drug Administration-Approved Technologies,"Stroke is an emergency in which delays in treatment can lead to significant loss of neurological function and be fatal. Technologies that increase the speed and accuracy of stroke diagnosis or assist in post-stroke rehabilitation can improve patient outcomes. No resource exists that comprehensively assesses artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-enabled technologies indicated for the management of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. We queried a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database, along with PubMed and private company websites, to identify the recent literature assessing the clinical performance of FDA-approved AI/ML-enabled technologies. The FDA has approved 22 AI/ML-enabled technologies that triage brain imaging for more immediate diagnosis or promote post-stroke neurological/functional recovery. Technologies that assist with diagnosis predominantly use convolutional neural networks to identify abnormal brain images (e.g., CT perfusion). These technologies perform comparably to neuroradiologists, improve clinical workflows (e.g., time from scan acquisition to reading), and improve patient outcomes (e.g., days spent in the neurological ICU). Two devices are indicated for post-stroke rehabilitation by leveraging neuromodulation techniques. Multiple FDA-approved technologies exist that can help clinicians better diagnose and manage stroke. This review summarizes the most up-to-date literature regarding the functionality, performance, and utility of these technologies so clinicians can make informed decisions when using them in practice.",https://openalex.org/W4380225038,2023,Anirudha S.

"Exploring the Relationship between Abusive Management, Self-Efficacy and Organizational Performance in the Context of Human–Machine Interaction Technology and Artificial Intelligence with the Effect of Ergonomics","(1) Background: Our study aims to explore the impact of abusive management and self-efficacy on corporate performance in the context of artificial intelligence-based human–machine interaction technology in enterprise performance evaluation. (2) Methods: Surveys were distributed to 578 participants in selected international companies in Turkey, Taiwan, Japan, and China. To reduce uncertainty and errors, the surveys were rigorously evaluated and did not show a normal distribution, as it was determined that 85 participants did not consciously fill out the questionnaires, and the questionnaires from the remaining 493 participants were used. By using the evaluation model of employee satisfaction based on a back propagation (BP) neural network, we explored the manifestation and impact of abusive management and self-efficacy. Using the listed real estate businesses as an example, we proposed a deep learning BP neural network-based employee job satisfaction evaluation model and a human–machine technology-based employee performance evaluation system under situational perception, according to the design requirements of human–machine interaction. (3) Results: The results show that the human–machine interface can log in according to the correct verbal instructions of the employees. In terms of age and education level variables, employees’ perceptions of leaders’ abusive management and self-efficacy are significantly different from their job performances, respectively (p &lt; 0.01).

Application of Artificial Intelligence-based Technology in Cancer Management: A Commentary on the Deployment of Artificial Neural Networks,"Artificial intelligence was recognised many years ago as a potential and powerful tool to predict disease outcome in many clinical situations. The conventional approaches using statistical methods have provided much information, but are subject to limitations imposed by the complexity of medical data. The structures of the important variants of the machine learning system artificial neural networks (ANN) are discussed and emphasis is given to the powerful analytical support that could be provided by ANN for the prediction of cancer progression and prognosis. The predictive ability of the cellular markers, DNA ploidy and cell-cycle profiles, and molecular markers, such as tumour promoter and suppressor gene, and growth factor and steroid hormone receptors in breast cancer management were also analysed. ANN systems have been successfully deployed to evaluate microRNA profiles of tumours which saliently sway cancer progression and prognosis of the disease, thus counteracting the negative implications of their numerical abundance. Finally, in this setting, the prospective technical improvements in artificial neural networks, as hybrid systems in combination with fuzzy logic and artificial immune networks were also addressed.",https://openalex.org/W2902895195,2018,Gajanan V.

DEVELOPING INNOVATION CAPABILITY IN ORGANISATIONS: A DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES APPROACH,"This paper draws together knowledge from a variety of fields to propose that innovation management can be viewed as a form of organisational capability. Excellent companies invest and nurture this capability, from which they execute effective innovation processes, leading to innovations in new product, services and processes, and superior business performance results. An extensive review of the literature on innovation management, along with a case study of Cisco Systems, develops a conceptual model of the firm as an innovation engine. This new operating model sees substantial investment in innovation capability as the primary engine for wealth creation, rather than the possession of physical assets. Building on the dynamic capabilities literature, an ""innovation capability"" construct is proposed with seven elements. These are vision and strategy, harnessing the competence base, organisational intelligence, creativity and idea management, organisational structures and systems, culture and climate, and management of technology.",https://openalex.org/W2101348440,2001,Benn Lawson; Danny Samson,The University of Melbourne

Artificial Intelligence Technology Based on Deep Learning in Building Construction Management System Modeling,"In order to explore the application of AI technology in construction management system modeling, the author proposed the application of a deep learning-based AI technology in construction management system modeling. The 3 D reconstruction deep learning model is first introduced, and then the model idea of the construction progress reliability control system is designed based on BIM (building information model). Second, the construction process of the 4dbim model is described, and the construction method is introduced. The construction of the model provides data information for the construction schedule reliability control system. Finally, the three functional modules of progress monitoring, progress reliability early warning, and progress prediction are realized by combining the S-curve comparison method, and the work of the system is described through case simulation. The early warning result is from June 7 to June 11, the progress deviation is between (−2%, 2%), and the progress is basically controlled. On June 13, the planned workload was 81.099%, and the actual cumulative workload was 7.099%, which was 4% less than the planned workload. The project progress was out of date, so it needs to be closely tracked. On June 15, the planned workload was 85.511%, and the actual cumulative workload was 80.899%, 4.5% less than the planned workload. The forecast result is the line forecast of the actual cumulative completion percentage on June 17. After calculation, the forecast result on June 17 is 84.311%. The progress deviation on June 17 was 5.21%. If no timely delay is taken on June 15, the delay will get worse. In addition, the system can predict the completion period of the project. When the actual percentage of cumulative completion is greater than or equal to 100%, it indicates that the project has been completed. Therefore, we can calculate the completion period of the three-storey project, and the construction period is about June 29 or 30. When the simulation can be carried out, the simulation number is set as 1000 times, the completion probability of the project is only 40%, and the completion probability is not too high. Artificial intelligence technology can realize progress monitoring, progress reliability early warning, and progress prediction. This system model prepares for software development and is conducive to improving the progress reliability control level of construction enterprises. Starting from the schedule planning subsystem and the schedule control subsystem, this paper studies the application of the artificial intelligence technology based on deep learning in the modeling of a building construction management system. The results show that this technology can effectively improve the efficiency of the building construction schedule management. Compared with the existing management methods, it shows great advantages in terms of operating costs and ease of use. It also promotes the application of artificial intelligence technology in the construction phase.",https://openalex.org/W4229457133,2022,Hongbo Wang; Yan Hu,Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University; Guangzhou Metro Design & Research Institute; Guangzhou Metro Group (China)

"How to Improve the Management of Acute Ischemic Stroke by Modern Technologies, Artificial Intelligence, and New Treatment Methods","Stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and disability in Europe. The European Stroke Action Plan (ESAP) defines four main targets for the years 2018 to 2030. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the use of innovative technologies and created pressure to improve internet networks. Moreover, 5G internet network will be helpful for the transfer and collecting of extremely big databases. Nowadays, the speed of internet connection is a limiting factor for robotic systems, which can be controlled and commanded potentially from various places in the world. Innovative technologies can be implemented for acute stroke patient management soon. Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are used increasingly often without the exception of medicine. Their implementation can be achieved in every level of stroke care. In this article, all steps of stroke health care processes are discussed in terms of how to improve them (including prehospital diagnosis, consultation, transfer of the patient, diagnosis, techniques of the treatment as well as rehabilitation and usage of AI). New ethical problems have also been discovered.

Literature review on the relationship between Artificial Intelligence Technologies with Digital Sports Marketing and Sports Management,"In recent years, artificial intelligence has shown its supremacy in various domains in a wide range of amusement games and has increased its utilization in the sports industry. The computer vision program used for matches provides a complete analysis of the matches that have happened, gathers and categorizes the data so that the coach or teams may make better strategic planning decisions, and displays the study results. They can make assessments that individuals ordinarily cannot do because of applications of artificial intelligence. The players' performance on their teams may be evaluated in this manner, allowing coaches to devise optimal game-play techniques for their respective squads. Analysis performed using artificial intelligence is also applied in the sporting arena, namely in motorsports racing. Follow-up on fouls committed is accomplished with artificial intelligence, and a chance to get an advantage over one's rivals in terms of strategy is investigated and pursued. The advent of new digital technologies has brought about a revolution in sports marketing, as in every other industry. It has led to the development of digital sports marketing. In this study, an examination employing artificial intelligence and digital technology was carried out, with the primary emphasis on digital sports management and digital sports marketing studies.

Analysing human-computer interaction behaviour in human resource management system based on artificial intelligence technology,"The aim is to optimise the procedures and reduce the workload of human resource management (HRM), thereby increasing the working efficiency and improving system performance. Deep learning (DL) algorithms are employed to build a CC neural network (BPNN)-based HRM system model. Then, this model is optimised and simulated, whose performance is verified through comparisons with other models. The comparative simulation demonstrates that the proposed system model converges the fastest. Results of the Leave-One-Out (LOO) method also prove the fastest convergence and the best optimisation effect of the proposed system model over classic models. In particular, it can converge at about 60 epochs and provides an accuracy of about 88.72%, 2.76% higher than other models at tops. Regarding the prediction performance, the proposed system model presents an excellent fitting effect. Through experiments, the constructed model converges faster and makes predictions more accurately, providing an experimental reference for the operation and intelligent development of HRM systems in the economic field in the future.",https://openalex.org/W3184246614,2021,Yuegang Song; Ruibing Wu,Henan Normal University; Xinxiang University

A text mining framework for discovering technological intelligence to support science and technology management,"Science and Technology (S and T) information presents a rich resource, essential for managing research and development (R and D) programs. Management of R and D has long been a labor-intensive process, relying extensively on the accumulated knowledge of experts within the organization. Furthermore, the rapid pace of S and T growth has increased the complexity of R and D management significantly. Fortunately, the parallel growth of information and of analytical tools offers the promise of advanced decision aids to support R and D management more effectively. Information retrieval, data mining and other information-based technologies are receiving increased attention. \nIn this thesis, a framework based on text mining techniques is proposed to discover useful intelligence implicit in large bodies of electronic text sources. This intelligence is a prime requirement for successful R and D management. This research extends the approach called Technology Opportunities Analysis (developed by the Technology Policy and Assessment Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, in conjunction with Search Technology, Inc.) to create the proposed framework. The commercialized software, called VantagePoint, is mainly used to perform basic analyses. In addition to utilizing functions in VantagePoint, this thesis also implements a novel text association rule mining algorithm for gathering related concepts among text data. Two algorithms based on text association rule mining are also implemented. The first algorithm called tree-structured networks is used to capture important aspects of both parent-child (hierarchical structure) and sibling relations (non-hierarchical structure) among related terms. The second algorithm called concept-grouping is used to construct term thesauri for data preprocessing. Finally, the framework is applied to Thai S and T publication abstracts toward the objective of improving R and D management. The results of the study can help support strategic decision-making on the direction of S and T programs in Thailand.",https://openalex.org/W2183476683,2004,Alisa Kongthon; Alan L. Porter,

Applications of Remote Sensing in Precision Agriculture: A Review,"Agriculture provides for the most basic needs of humankind: food and fiber. The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015–2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications.",https://openalex.org/W3088154325,2020,Rajendra P.

Innovation of enterprise financial management based on machine learning and artificial intelligence technology,"With the development of economic globalization, the competition between companies is increasing and becoming a norm. As one of the main value-added tools, financial management has greatly improved its position in business management. Traditional financial management is difficult to keep up with the pace of modern company management, which to a large extent hinders the effective development of enterprises. Therefore, under the current macroeconomic background, the necessity of studying financial management innovation has become more urgent. In this context, seeking innovation is not only a problem for enterprises, but also an important strategic goal of economic development and the concept of national modern enterprise development. Many studies have been carried out in the field of technological innovation, and few have focused on innovation in financial management. Exploratory research on the factors that affect the choice of financial management mode and route planning is important both in reality and in theory.

Artificial intelligence in cancer imaging: Clinical challenges and applications,"Abstract Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care.",https://openalex.org/W2911605224,2019,Wenya Linda Bi; Ahmed Hosny; Matthew B.

"The growing field of digital psychiatry: current evidence and the future of apps, social media, chatbots, and virtual reality","As the COVID‐19 pandemic has largely increased the utilization of telehealth, mobile mental health technologies – such as smartphone apps, vir­tual reality, chatbots, and social media – have also gained attention. These digital health technologies offer the potential of accessible and scalable interventions that can augment traditional care. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive update on the overall field of digital psychiatry, covering three areas. First, we outline the relevance of recent technological advances to mental health research and care, by detailing how smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence and virtual reality present new opportunities for “digital phenotyping” and remote intervention. Second, we review the current evidence for the use of these new technological approaches across different mental health contexts, covering their emerging efficacy in self‐management of psychological well‐being and early intervention, along with more nascent research supporting their use in clinical management of long‐term psychiatric conditions – including major depression; anxiety, bipolar and psychotic disorders; and eating and substance use disorders – as well as in child and adolescent mental health care. Third, we discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities towards real‐world implementation, using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i‐PARIHS) framework to explain how the innovations themselves, the recipients of these innovations, and the context surrounding innovations all must be considered to facilitate their adoption and use in mental health care systems. We conclude that the new technological capabilities of smartphones, artificial intelligence, social media and virtual reality are already changing mental health care in unforeseen and exciting ways, each accompanied by an early but promising evidence base. We point out that further efforts towards strengthening implementation are needed, and detail the key issues at the patient, provider and policy levels which must now be addressed for digital health technologies to truly improve mental health research and treatment in the future.",https://openalex.org/W3197232629,2021,John Torous; Sandra Bucci; Imogen Bell,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Massachusetts Mental Health Center

Analysis of the Impact of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Technology on Supply Chain Management,"Differentiated production and supply chain management (SCM) areas benefit from the IoT, Big Data, and the data-management capabilities of the AI paradigm. Many businesses have wondered how the arrival of AI will affect planning, organization, optimization, and logistics in the context of SCM. Information symmetry is very important here, as maintaining consistency between output and the supply chain is aided by processing and drawing insights from big data. We consider continuous (production) and discontinuous (supply chain) data to satisfy delivery needs to solve the shortage problem. Despite a surplus of output, this article addresses the voluptuous deficiency problem in supply chain administration. This research serves as an overview of AI for SCM practitioners. The report then moves into an in-depth analysis of the most recent studies on and applications of AI in the supply chain industry. This work introduces a novel approach, Incessant Data Processing (IDP), for handling harmonized data on both ends, which should reduce the risk of incorrect results. This processing technique detects shifts in the data stream and uses them to predict future suppressions of demand. Federated learning gathers and analyzes information at several points in the supply chain and is used to spot the shifts. The learning model is educated to forecast further supply chain actions in response to spikes and dips in demand. The entire procedure is simulated using IoT calculations and collected data. An improved prediction accuracy of 9.93%, a reduced analysis time of 9.19%, a reduced data error of 9.77%, and increased alterations of 10.62% are the results of the suggested method.",https://openalex.org/W4386913048,2023,Xiao Zeng; Yi Jing,Guizhou Institute of Technology; King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang; Guizhou Normal University

However, one of specific challenges to achieve smart manufacturing with these strategies is how to converge the manufacturing physical world and the virtual world, so as to realize a series of smart operations in the manufacturing process, including smart interconnection, smart interaction, smart control and management, etc. In this context, as a basic unit of manufacturing, shop-floor is required to reach the interaction and convergence between physical and virtual spaces, which is not only the imperative demand of smart manufacturing, but also the evolving trend of itself. Accordingly, a novel concept of digital twin shopfloor (DTS) based on digital twin is explored and its four key components are discussed, including physical shop-floor, virtual shop-floor, shop-floor service system, and shop-floor digital twin data. What is more, the operation mechanisms and implementing methods for DTS are studied and key technologies as well as challenges ahead are investigated, respectively.",https://openalex.org/W2757110387,2017,Fei Tao; Meng Zhang,Beihang University; ORCID
"Rationality, foolishness, and adaptive intelligence","Abstract Technologies of model‐based rationality are the core technologies of strategic management, having largely replaced earlier technologies that placed greater reliance on traditional practice or on communication either with the stars or with the gods. The technologies used by organizations in their pursuit of intelligence can be imagined to change over time as a result of responding to the successes and failures associated with the technologies. Although technologies of rationality seem clearly to be effective instruments of exploitation in relatively simple situations and to derive their adaptive advantage from those capabilities, their ventures in more complex explorations seem often to lead to huge mistakes and thus unlikely to be sustained by adaptive processes. Whether their survival as instruments of exploratory novelty in complex situations is desirable is a difficult question to answer, but it seems likely that any such survival may require hitchhiking on their successes in simpler worlds. Survival may also be served by the heroism of fools and the blindness of true believers. Their imperviousness to feedback is both the despair of adaptive intelligence and, conceivably, its salvation.

Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technology in Improved Supply Chain Financial Risk Management,"With greater frequency and granularity than ever before, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology can help businesses achieve next-level performance in the supply chain. Blockchain can reliably construct the framework for recording data across endpoints, whereas AI can assist in data matching. This study investigates how to apply blockchain technology and artificial intelligence together in supply chains to push the boundaries of operational effectiveness, promote sustainable growth, and monetize data. This study has examined how blockchain can be used to track financial operations in the supply chain and also aims to determine how artificial intelligence contributes to supply chain management. The study's anticipated results will increase knowledge of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence in supply chain risk management and encourage practitioners and researchers to think about using these technologies in future context-aware research.",https://openalex.org/W4360585324,2022,K.
