                <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The proposal introduces a real‑time AI‑driven framework for innovation management, which is a notable departure from the predominantly static, historical‑data‑based models currently in use. While similar concepts exist in adjacent fields, applying them directly to innovation management is still relatively novel, warranting a score of 4. Technically, the integration of real‑time data pipelines, adaptive AI models, and decision‑support interfaces is achievable with current technology, though it will require careful engineering and organizational alignment; this realistic but non‑trivial effort merits a score of 4. The expected outcomes—reducing time‑to‑market by 30% and boosting innovation success rates by 25%—represent a substantial improvement over existing practices, indicating high potential impact and justifying a score of 5.</p>

                <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The proposal targets a relatively underexplored intersection of human-AI collaboration and innovation ecosystems, offering a fresh framework for knowledge co‑creation. While the core concepts of human‑AI interaction exist, applying them to systemic innovation processes and quantifying gains in output and decision quality is novel, justifying a high originality score. Feasibility is moderate: building an integrated paradigm requires multidisciplinary expertise, robust AI tooling, and organizational change management, which are realistic but non‑trivial, hence a 3. The potential impact is substantial; if the paradigm delivers the claimed 60% increase in innovation output and 40% improvement in decision quality, it could reshape how firms innovate, warranting a high impact score.</p>
